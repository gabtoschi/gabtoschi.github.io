    <p>Hi! Pull a chair, sit down and welcome to my cozy home in the internet hell! <strong>My name is Gabriel Toschi (he/him)</strong>, I'm a Brazilian software engineer, amateur game designer and non-fiction writer. But in this website, I'm just a silly person trying to have fun with my projects and articles. I live nowadays on Taubaté, a country town in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, with my wife and my three cats.</p>
<p>Well, what I can say about myself? If this was a job resume, I would say that I graduated as a Computer Science bachelor from the <a href="https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/about">Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação at the University of São Paulo (ICMC-USP)</a> — and did way more calculus tests that I wanted. Nowadays, I work as a front-end web developer in a major retail company in Brazil and I'm not looking for new opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>But you are not here for this, are you?</strong> You probably have seen an article about Club Penguin minigames and wanted to see who wrote it! So, yeah, <a href="/blog/why-i-created-this-blog">I'm a person that always have been on the internet</a>, since I was born, and now I finally got a web space to be proud of. I'm always using my <strong>curiosity</strong> to learn about things that catch my eye, my <strong>creativity</strong> to make new things and remix the ones that already exists, and the <strong>chaos</strong> inside me to go one step further and have a little bit of fun.</p>
<p>In this website, you will found a (non-exhaustive) of <a href="/#projects">all my past projects</a>, including digital and tabletop games that I made and articles that I wrote in other places. And <a href="/blog">in my blog</a>, I'm always writing original texts and reviews. If you want to get in touch, you can send me an email in <strong>eu (at) gabtoschi (dot) com</strong>, or follow me on <a href="https://t.me/gabtoschi">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://peoplemaking.games/@gabtoschi">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gabtoschi.com">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gabtoschi">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44763507/">my Steam curator page</a>.</p>
