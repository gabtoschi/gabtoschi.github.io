    <p>Yes, I like huge adventures, with a lot of systems and mechanics, and a deep story that will make me cry; there's some moments that all I want is to submerge in a big game and have fun. But, specially nowadays working 40 hours per week, I also have my time to relax, put a podcast on and just play a <strong>small and cozy puzzle game</strong>. The concept behind <strong>Storyblocks: The King</strong> was really cool, but the execution was so bad that I just came disappointed after some hours.</p>
<p>In theory, <strong>Storyblocks: The King</strong> is a choose-your-own-adventure game (where you choose how the story can continue) mixed with a block placement puzzle, what is genuinely a good idea. CYODs are commonly more focused only on the narrative, so having a more thinky element there could be really cool. The presentation here isn't the best, but works as a generic medieval setting, what can also be said about the plot and characters too: most of them feels like an mediocre children book.</p>

<p>In reality, nothing really works that well. <strong>The &quot;puzzle&quot; is just connecting two points</strong> in a grid using dominoes and the &quot;challenge&quot; is create a path big enough to use all the pieces available. There's no actual mechanics being introduced, you just put the blocks in a void until two cubes are connected. Sometimes, you have two &quot;goal&quot; squares and the one you choose to connect indicates where the story goes. No, you don't have any information about those &quot;options&quot;, so you just go on pure guess.</p>
<p>I imagine that on PC, using a mouse, <strong>Storyblocks: The King</strong> has a better usability, but playing it on the Nintendo Switch was also a nightmare by itself. The control choice is strange — it isn't okay to use Y instead of the Home button to open the menu, you know —, all the grid navigation is cursor-based even on a joystick and you can't even use touch controls on Portable Mode. Play this game is a challenge by itself, and if you want to find other &quot;complete stories&quot;, you need to repeat the first levels every time you start a new &quot;run&quot;.</p>

<p>As a fan of low-budget cozy puzzle games, I'm really disappointed. As I said, <strong>Storyblocks: The King</strong> has a great potential conceptually, but <strong>the execution is far away from a pleasant experience</strong>. The stories are generic, the &quot;puzzle&quot; is repetitive and lacks any kind of depth, and the controls make it even hard to get any fun from the package. I know that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover (or by a review from a blog), but you are probably better going after other stories.</p>

    The team behind this game sent me a press key so I could play it and write my review. Thanks for the trust!
