        <h4>Solving these 3D jigsaw puzzles is way far from magical</h4>
      </div>

  <div id="post-content" class="post-content container">
    <p>I love puzzle games, but not every puzzle game I like needs to be big and complex. Sometimes, I only need a simple jigsaw puzzle to solve when I listen to a podcast and zone out after a stressful day. Beautiful pictures, a good interface, no timers and I can chill connecting pieces as this was the only thing I have to do (it isn't). <strong>Harmony's Odyssey</strong> has almost all of that, but not in a pleasing package.</p>
<p>There's a small story being told here: a little witch girl had a cat problem with her magic wand and <strong>all the world was broken into scrambled pieces</strong>. Your goal in <strong>Harmony's Odyssey</strong> is to click in pairs of blocks to swap their positions and remount the dioramas using only the broken objects as clues. To be fair, <strong>it works</strong> but nothing really gets your attention. The scenarios are really colorful (sometimes too much colorful) and it's easy to solve each puzzle.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/harmonys-odyssey/harmony.jpg" alt="Harmony's Odyssey"></p>
<p>The real problem of <strong>Harmony's Odyssey</strong> to me isn't that core gameplay, but the bad decisions that were used to wrap it. I'm a huge fan of interfaces that only uses symbols to convey all the buttons and actions, but <strong>I still can't understand what some things mean here.</strong> Is this a bonus level or a required challenge? Am I buying an upgrade or unlocking an achievement? Where is the next puzzle to solve??? I wanted answers, but only got frustration.</p>
<p>And when I think I found my way through the bizarre UI, I found <strong>minigames in Harmony's Odyssey</strong>. Trusting your classic game knowledge (because all of them are inspired by old magazine puzzles), <strong>the game doesn't have real explanation of how they work</strong>. I know there was a &quot;spot the differences&quot; minigame, but apparently I can't miss a click? And you can get upgrades to help you, but they only works in some specific styles? Once again, I wish I had understood what was happening there.</p>

</p>
<p>Even if you're not bothered by the confusing interface or frustrating minigames, all you'll get in <strong>Harmony's Odyssey</strong> is still mediocre jigsaw puzzles. The dioramas themselves are cute and colorful, and solving them isn't necessarily bad, but I believe there are best options in the stores if you just want to put some beautiful pieces together. I was expecting some magic in my relaxing time, but I don't think this magical wand is my type.</p>

    The team behind this game sent me a press key so I could play it and write my review. Thanks for the trust!
