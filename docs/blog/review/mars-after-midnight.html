    <p>I'm a little ashamed to reveal this, but I had never played a <a href="https://dukope.com/"><strong>Lucas Pope</strong></a> game until now. Yes, I know that his games are praised for years now, but it never felt the right time to do it. <a href="https://papersplea.se/">Papers, Please</a> has an amazing concept, but the theme was too heavy for what was happening in my real life in the past years. And I still want some vacation days to only dedicate on solving <a href="https://obradinn.com/">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>'s puzzles. Who knew that the <a href="/blog/playdate-full-review"><strong>Playdate</strong></a> would be the place where I would finally discover by myself how amazing is his work?</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/mars-after-midnight/intro.png" alt="Mars After Midnight"></p>
<p>That said, <strong>Mars After Midnight</strong> isn't exactly you expect from a Pope's creation. From <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/mars-after-midnight/devlog/261758/mars-after-midnight">his own words</a>, this game is &quot;a little more light-hearted, something his kids might like&quot;. It uses the core idea of Papers, Please of being the one behind a door, but puts you as the host of <strong>a Community Support Center. For aliens, in Mars.</strong> You have to plan the sessions every night, accept only the right martians inside and even manage the free food table you have as refreshments to the attendees.</p>
<p>This three-part mechanical loop is the core of <strong>Mars After Midnight</strong>, and the main bit is the process of <strong>seeing aliens and trying to find the right ones for tonight's session</strong>. Depending of what you planned, you may want different martians attending — only sad cyclopes or only the ones with cracked skulls, per example — and you <strong>use the Playdate's crank to open the little hatch</strong> to see more of the candidates. This can feel a small job for the crank that is so talked about, but it's the perfect one. There isn't a lot of depth in here (like you would expect in Papers, Please), but it's so fun to play that I always ended up with a smile.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/mars-after-midnight/aliens.png" alt="Mars After Midnight"></p>
<p>Truly, <strong>I love how Mars After Midnight is silly even on the gameplay</strong>, and I don't mean in a bad way. All the aliens are strange but friendly, and half of the sessions requires &quot;special equipment&quot; that can be used with the B button (like a magnifying glass to see which tiny bugs actually have a knife). In one of the levels, they give me a horn and I passed 30 minutes just pressing the button and showing everyone <strong>THAT I HAVE A HORN</strong>. I'm the idiot person that goes to the pet shop and squeeze every dog toy so I can make sound, so, yeah, my wife got really mad because of the horn but I was very happy.</p>
<p>The other parts of the gameplay aren't that silly, but they work as intended. After you accept an alien, they can eat the free food and your job is to <strong>clean and re-arrange the plates for next creature</strong>, like a simpler Hanoi Tower puzzle. And after a level is finished, you can choose what to do in the next day, <strong>planning the session</strong>, where to put posters to promote it in the colony and what will be the refreshments. And then, you repeat this cycle until you can help all the martians.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/mars-after-midnight/extra.png" alt="Mars After Midnight"></p>
<p>The best way to enjoy what <strong>Mars After Midnight</strong> can offer is definitely in small sessions, because the gameplay can feel really repetitive if you tried to do five or six nights at once. The lack of a more complex plot also doesn't help, and even the funny moments can get a little boring if seen in one go. But <strong>the game was perfect to play in breaks during a job day</strong>: sending aliens to the air with a giant spring is always what I need after a boring and complicated meeting. At the end, using those martians as serotonin pills was more effective then trying to help everyone in only one afternoon.</p>
<p>Even without a deep story, this game is so charismatic that <strong>looking into the details to appreciating them is the best way to experience Mars After Midnight</strong>. From the alien speech that you learn during the levels, to the dreams that our protagonists have after a night of work and the details at the back of the street... Even on the small screen of Playdate, it was good to help those Martians, however necessary.</p>

<p>I don't know yet who loved more this game: my inner child who laughs like an idiot at a horn, or the tired adult that liked the breaks in a work day to help some martians. Lucas Pope's ability of transforming a boring job into an interesting game is still amazing, and even if there isn't the same depth of his past games, the light-hearted premise made it an unique experience. If you have a Playdate and a silly game catches your attention, <strong>Mars After Midnight is a must-play</strong>.</p>
