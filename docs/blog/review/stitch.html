        <h4>Embroidery and puzzle fans together in one colorful game</h4>
      </div>

  <div id="post-content" class="post-content container">
    <p>People can't show me a colorful abstract puzzle game and expect me to not go completely crazy wanting to play it. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/lTjjKC9gHPM?si=FzA0_-F1VuC5BqHC&amp;t=952">last week's Nintendo Indie World Showcase</a>, I was presented to <strong>stitch.</strong>, a game that was going out from Apple Arcade and finally going a version to the Switch. Your goal is to fill numbered grids to make beautiful images on embroidery hoops, the perfect mix and match of mechanics that helps my brain relax.</p>
<p>Looking into some screenshots of the game for the first time, you may think that <strong>stitch.</strong> is just a variation on nonograms (or Picross, for the Nintendo fans out there). In this case, you are wrong, but not too far. The team at <a href="https://www.lykkestudios.com/">Lykke Studios</a> was inspired by <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/shikaku/"><strong>another pen-and-paper Japanese puzzle called Shikaku</strong></a> — created by the famous company Nikoli, the ones responsible for popularizing Sudoku! — where the numbers are inside the grid, not outside.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/stitch/shikaku.jpg" alt="stitch."></p>
<p>In original Shikaku rules, <strong>your goal is to the divide a figure into rectangles</strong>, and each rectangle need to have only one number inside it, that will indicate how many grid cells are inside that specific shape. For example, if you see a number 6, the correct solution will have a 6x1 or a 2x3 rectangle with only this number 6 inside. Although <strong>stitch.</strong> follow all those rules, and even give you a classic Shikaku puzzle every day to solve, their approach to this formula make it a little bit easier, but more accessible and relaxing.</p>
<p>Getting inspiration from the embroidery theme, <strong>every level in stitch. is called a Hoop</strong>, a big figure that you need to sew with colored threads. Instead of showing you all the numbers from the start, <strong>the game divides the whole picture in smaller sections</strong>, each one with its own Shikaku puzzle. Some smaller Hoops will have 20-30 sections, but bigger ones have more than 100 little parts until you complete a full drawing.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/stitch/complete.jpg" alt="stitch."></p>
<p>As I said (and you may imagine), this simplify a lot the process of solving a Shikaku puzzle because most of its complexity is in all the possibilities that can happen in bigger grids. It's like <strong>stitch. is confirming your tries step by step</strong>, instead of making you a lot of progress without knowing if you are going in the right direction. If you get stuck, though, you can also use hints in any part of any Hoop.</p>
<p>If you are already a fan of those pen-and-paper puzzles, <strong>stitch.</strong> will seem a little to easy and maybe even boring. But for me, that literally plays Picross to get sleepy, <strong>allowing me to complete those amazing drawings without a lot of complexity was a perfect way to relax</strong> when listening to a podcast, for example. That said, here's a tip: some hard Hoops can need from you way more brain power than the rest of the game.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/stitch/menu.jpg" alt="stitch."></p>
<p>Having actual figures to complete and not just random grids are also a plus for me, because it gave a sense of really cool sense of completion, that I think combines really well with the whole sewing theme. Some of them are really beautiful also, <strong>an amazing visual job by the team</strong>. My favorite part is that some of the sections are a little bit curved to help create more interesting pictures, but still following the orthogonal rules of Shikaku.</p>
<p>Talking about content, you will have a lot of embroidery to finish if you want to complete all the challenges in <strong>stitch.</strong> The base game have <strong>180 Hoops to play</strong>, and a new Weekly Hoop (inspired by current events or holidays) every 7 days help to increase this number. Even though it's a port of a mobile game, there is no ads or microtransaction locks: when you finish the tutorial, almost all the content are automatically available to you to tackle. <strong>You can even recolor your favorites</strong> in Free Stitch mode, if you are more artistic capable than me (it doesn't need much).</p>

<p>It easy to see what is the target audience for <strong>stitch.</strong> already completing the first level. Their goal wasn't to create a digital version of Shikaku for experts, but use the amazing rules of this puzzle to make a relaxing and visually appealing game to people that likes to turn off their brain with those types of challenges. As a declared fan of Picross, I can only say that those Hoops became also my favorite, and I just hope to keep sewing for much more nights before bed. (Yes, I'm asking for the sequel, I finish those games fast...)</p>

    The team behind this game sent me a press key so I could play it and write my review. Thanks for the trust!
