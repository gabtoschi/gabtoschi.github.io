    <p><strong>Bem Feito</strong> is one of those games that <strong>the less you know about it, the better your experience will be</strong>. But I still need to write a review about it, I cannot just write a single phrase and get away with it. So, without spoilers, let's talk about this mysterious small game that, although it has a lot of qualities, maybe promised too much and couldn't get me that excited for the whole ride.</p>
<p>This title is actually an &quot;expanded port&quot; of a game called <strong>Bem Feito</strong>, supposedly launched in 1999 by Brazilian company MEGASOFT as the only title of its portable gaming device, the Jogaroto (yes, this is fictional, but let's roll with it). You follow <strong>Reginaldo</strong>, a little boy living in a little planet, doing his chores and meeting some new friends. During each day in the game, you have a list of tasks to do, and this includes exploring the place and making some choices to progress the story.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/bem-feito/home.jpg" alt="Bem Feito"></p>
<p>At this point, you can imagine <strong>there's more than meet the eye</strong> in this little old ROM to discover (or you just read the content warning in the Steam page). All I can say is that the process of finding this new layer behind the life simulation game was really interesting and compelling, that glued me and my wife for 2 hours at the TV just trying to see how the story would unfold. The way the controls work could be a little better too, but nothing you can't learn with some simple trial and error.</p>
<p>Visually, <strong>Bem Feito</strong> also does its job really well. It's great how the game uses a monochromatic palette to invoke a Game Boy-like retro style, but the purple tint and the perspective camera <strong>make it a strange (but totally intentional) uncanny valley</strong>, where you know this couldn't have been possible in a 1999 portable, but the mere existence of it creates a mystery by itself.</p>
<p><img src="/img/reviews/bem-feito/fishing.jpg" alt="Bem Feito"></p>
<p><strong>The experience of exploring a strange lost media game is perfectly made here</strong>, and I would love if <strong>Bem Feito</strong> was only this, even if this resulted in a smaller game. But there's more, not in the same level of quality. You can also get <strong>access to messages and documents</strong> that have information about how the game is created, who was involved and why it was forgotten by the general public. I don't dislike the concept of expanding the lore, giving you more to theorize about, but the execution was really subpar.</p>
<p>Instead of rewarding a good exploration of the ROM, or smart players that connected the dots, 90% of this part of the game is just... reading? All the passwords you need to access locked information are on the game achievements' names, and <strong>even you can find a secret or two by yourself, I don't think it was satisfactory.</strong> Without this lore dump, the adventures of Reginaldo were truly a mystery with a message, but now, it feels something too artificial. I know that every theory in our heads are better than all the true stories we learn after, but <strong>the riddle was so plain that I wish I hadn't tasted it</strong>.</p>

</p>
<p>It's strange to say like that, but I wish <strong>Bem Feito</strong> finished early when I was playing it. It understands so well the idea of what is the core of a gaming creepypasta, but fails on complement with a mystery that, to be fair, didn't need to be explicit to pass its message. I hope to not have damaged the experience of the game to you, but I hope to have aligned your expectations so you can enjoy the best parts of this amazing work. And, if you really want to meet Reginaldo and his friends, remember: you become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.</p>

    The team behind this game sent me a press key so I could play it and write my review. Thanks for the trust!
