    <title>Ranking every Club Penguin minigame (because it&#39;s Christmas!)</title>

    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you ever talked to me about &amp;quot;my favorite games&amp;quot;, I have mentioned &lt;strong&gt;Club Penguin&lt;/strong&gt;, a Flash-made children MMO launched in 2005, sold to Disney in 2007 and closed forever in 2017. The idea was very simple: you create a cartoonish penguin as an avatar, got to a island full of snow, fun and regulated chat messages and had fun! Or, at least, moderated fun, if you couldn&#39;t have the paid membership at the time. Poor penguin cannot buy clothes with imaginary money because they can&#39;t pay real money too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even never being a paid member, &lt;strong&gt;I completely loved Club Penguin&lt;/strong&gt;. Gabriel here was a rat of 2000s children MMOs and no one could get in my heart like CP did. For so many years, I logged in at least once a month to check the new items, parties and activities. In fact, I played a lot even past 2017, in a lot of private servers created and maintained by fans during the years. At least, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61107939&quot;&gt;until Disney started sending THE LITERAL POLICE to close down servers&lt;/a&gt; and making almost every one desist of the penguin dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to play again, but I can&#39;t, so remembering is the best way to do it for now. And I can&#39;t remember about Club Penguin without time traveling to December 2008. The first non-English CP servers were being launched... in Brazilian Portuguese! I got an email from Disney Brasil&#39;s newsletter at the time, created an account and that&#39;s it. My first penguin was born, and &lt;strong&gt;I started my Club Penguin journey in Christmas Party 2008&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/christmas2008.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Migrator at Christmas Party 2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, Club Penguin and Christmas are the same in my tiny brain. And the blog is mine, so my &amp;quot;holiday special&amp;quot; will be about my favorite part of the game: &lt;strong&gt;minigames!&lt;/strong&gt; They were smaller games that you could play for coins, and they were well integrated to the bigger plot and scenario (instead of just having a page with them, like Neopets). At least, 50% of my CP playing time was just on them. Some were specially great, some were like a rotten hot sauce pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m inviting you to a trip through penguin memory lane in a special, too personal &lt;strong&gt;Club Penguin minigame definitive ranking&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#39;m not counting minigames exclusive to timed parties (like the The Fair ones), console or mobile games (like the EPF duology or Game Day) or the Club Penguin app version (that I never used). Only common, always available minigames on the web version. &lt;strong&gt;As criteria, I&#39;m just using my personal taste, really. You may have a different list, and that&#39;s fine. You&#39;re wrong, though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;31) Dance Contest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2009 to finally give Night Club a real minigame, &lt;strong&gt;Dance Contest&lt;/strong&gt; was a pure and simple Dance Dance Revolution clone. Some colored arrows go up, you press them following the music and you get points! There was only 6 songs to choose, and half of them were member-only, so I could only play 3 of them (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG93z4cwn08&quot;&gt;Epic Win&lt;/a&gt; was my favorite). Not only the songs, but only members had online multiplayer and purple puffles dancing with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/dancecontest.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dance Contest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if it was just a DDR clone, why &lt;strong&gt;Dance Contest is the worst Club Penguin minigame?&lt;/strong&gt; Some years ago, in a private server, as a Stepmania and DDR keyboard scholar that I am, decided to get the AAA grade in every song of the minigame. I even downloaded a software to remap my own keyboard and getting a Flash game recognize the patterns I used in other games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, after the first song, I discovered that &lt;strong&gt;ALL THE ARROWS WERE COMPLETELY RANDOM&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only the same song would have different maps (because the algorithm would choose them at random), but &lt;strong&gt;THEY NEVER FOLLOWED THE SONG BEAT&lt;/strong&gt;. It&#39;s the ONLY THING a DDR clone needs to do: follow the fucking music! I don&#39;t know how they messed it up, but Dance Contest deserves the last place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;30) Paint by Letters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I just discovered that this game existed when &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Games&quot;&gt;looking at Club Penguin Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for writing this article. Apparently, &lt;strong&gt;Paint by Letters&lt;/strong&gt; was a collection of three typing games in form of books at Coffee Shop&#39;s Book Room, where you type the story and, sometimes, choose what to type to change the plot. And maybe some small puzzles too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/paintbyletters.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paint by Letters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This minigame was &lt;strong&gt;only available in the English servers&lt;/strong&gt; in Club Penguin, probably because of the focus on language — translating it would be a nightmare. But I mostly played CP in Portuguese and the game doesn&#39;t even existed to me. So my ignorance about is just not greater than my hate for Dance Contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;29) Card-Jitsu Snow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to explain this one, I will need to advance some context about a game that is way higher in the list. All you need to know (for now): Card-Jitsu was a digital card game on Club Penguin with a ninja theme, where you compete head-to-head battles using colored cards and a rock-paper-scissors mechanic using 3 elements (fire, water and snow). Got it? Right, back to the worse game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/cardjitsu-snow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Card-Jitsu Snow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the success of Card-Jitsu, CP staff wanted to expand on the ninja storyline and created three original &amp;quot;spin-offs&amp;quot;, each one inspired by an element. &lt;strong&gt;Card-Jitsu Snow&lt;/strong&gt; was the last one to be released (in 2013) and it&#39;s also one of the most strange minigames on Club Penguin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a multiplayer competitive game that used the Card-Jitsu cards in different ways, they just created a &lt;strong&gt;way-too-simple tactical RPG&lt;/strong&gt; — their own bad version of Fire Emblem! You started a level with other two penguins, each one in a role with different abilities, and then just attacked evil snowmen. The cards were only used as a charged final attack! IN A CARD GAME SPIN-OFF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;472&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxsTsGC0Jt4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in my Club Penguin semi-hiatus when this released, but I remember looking at it and just not having fun at all. The battles were boring, the Card-Jitsu inspiration was only thematic and the game was way more resource-consuming than the rest of CP, my computer at the time just couldn&#39;t even run it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a shame because they invested a lot on &lt;strong&gt;explain the Card-Jitsu lore&lt;/strong&gt;, including the origin story of Sensei, the NPC responsible to bring the card game to the island in the first place (more about him later). There&#39;s even a true final boss! But with a mediocre game, I just ignored it. It happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;28) DJ3K&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably a lot of people have liked &lt;strong&gt;DJ3K&lt;/strong&gt; way more than me, but it never got me mostly by its simplicity and lack of objective. Launched in 2008, it was the first Night Club minigame. You started it and got your penguin &lt;strong&gt;behind the DJ turntable in the club&lt;/strong&gt;: when you pressed the buttons, sounds and music started to be played. You continue to press, the remix continued to happen, your penguin gets happy and you get coins. That&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/dj3k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DJ3K&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun for the first 10 minutes and than just became boring for me. If you were a member, you could record the songs and use them as the background music for your igloo, buy new records to use in the remixes and even bring your yellow puffle with you... But I wasn&#39;t, so just pressing buttons was not that cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;27) SoundStudio&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least they tried, right? The LAST game ever released on the original Club Penguin was &lt;strong&gt;SoundStudio&lt;/strong&gt;, in 2014, as &lt;strong&gt;a replacement for DJ3K&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea was the same, but instead of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&quot;&gt;skeuomorphic&lt;/a&gt; DJ turntable interface, SoundStudio was literally a &lt;strong&gt;digital drum pad&lt;/strong&gt; with musical and CP samples. How you play was the same, but it was way better to understand how the music was being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/soundstudio.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SoundStudio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selling point of SoundStudio was the recording: instead of just listening in your own igloos, penguins could &amp;quot;publish&amp;quot; their tracks to a public queue, that would be used as &lt;strong&gt;the actual soundtrack for the Night Club room!&lt;/strong&gt; Like, everyone there could listen to the songs created by other players, which was really nice and impossible to do in the early years of CP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, they locked this feature (in-game and inside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/SoundStudio_App&quot;&gt;standalone app&lt;/a&gt;) behind the paid membership. So the (teenager at this point) me couldn&#39;t even show my art to the world! So, yeah, if you get an OK game and even put it behind real money, I won&#39;t love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;26) Card-Jitsu Fire&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want more penguin ninja lore? Snow was the last, but &lt;strong&gt;Card-Jitsu Fire&lt;/strong&gt; was the first elemental spin-off, launched in 2009. In a concept way more in line of I was expecting from something derived from a card game, &lt;strong&gt;Fire was a board game&lt;/strong&gt;! Your goal was to compete with other players for energy when walking in stones at a volcano. Card-Jitsu battles (using the cards) would determine if you gain or lose energy in each turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love board games, right? So why this is so low at the list, you can ask me? From all the tabletop experiences already made in the history of humanity until 2009, why, in the name of sanity, &lt;strong&gt;THEY CHOSE TO CREATE A ROLL-AND-MOVE ONE?&lt;/strong&gt; You got a number from a roulette, walk that amount of stones, play a card battle and hope to get energy. I tried to play it more during my time at private servers some years ago and I couldn&#39;t last 3 games. At least, the Club Penguin version of Monopoly is able to finish a match in less than a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/cardjitsu-fire.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Card-Jitsu Fire&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a personal note, I remember playing A LOT of Card-Jitsu Fire on the original island when I was a child. Like, it was boring and I didn&#39;t liked roll-and-move games at the time, so why I played it so much? Searching about it, I remembered: this game was member-only &lt;strong&gt;BESIDES TWO WEEKS IN 2011&lt;/strong&gt;. During the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Card-Jitsu_Party_2011&quot;&gt;Card-Jitsu Party 2011&lt;/a&gt;, the game was available for everyone. 15 days and it would be gone forever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I played &lt;strong&gt;ONLY CARD-JITSU FIRE (and Water) for 2 entire weeks in my life&lt;/strong&gt;, trying to get all the exclusive items. Yes, it was made a open-for-everyone game in 2013, but who cares? A Club Penguin minigame gave me Stockholm syndrome and I don&#39;t know what to do with this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;25) Sled Racing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the five original minigames in Club Penguin from 2005, &lt;strong&gt;Sled Racing&lt;/strong&gt; was one of the games that were always there. You could go to the Ski Hill, choose a sled run, wait for more penguins to show up and compete! The game was a simple autorunner and your goal was just avoid obstacles to not stay behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/sledracing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sled Racing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, &lt;strong&gt;there was nothing wrong with Sled Racing&lt;/strong&gt;. It was always available for everyone, it was easy to find people to play with and it&#39;s really thematic with a snowy island full of penguins. But the game didn&#39;t have much substance after two or three races, the amount of coins you get was little... With so much cool games in the island, I just can&#39;t bothered to play it that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;24) Find Four&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever played &lt;strong&gt;a board game called Connect Four&lt;/strong&gt;? It&#39;s a classic! You drop colored tokens in a vertically plastic grid, trying to get four of your pieces in a line to win. If you don&#39;t, you could just open Club Penguin and play &lt;strong&gt;Find Four&lt;/strong&gt; in the Ski Lodge. It&#39;s literally the same game, and it&#39;s incredible how they got away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/findfour.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Find Four&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, it&#39;s was fun, people seems to love it, but... yeah, it was only an old board game that I never played physically. There&#39;s another board game version in this list that I loved way more, so I hope to redeem myself soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;23) Bits &amp;amp; Bolts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for an arcade triple feature? Since 2005, &lt;strong&gt;Night Club&#39;s second floor had arcade machines&lt;/strong&gt; with exclusive games (and, after 2011, it officially became the island&#39;s Arcade). I never really loved them, and I would ignore them even more after July 2020, when they &lt;strong&gt;LOCKED LEVELS&lt;/strong&gt; behind the paid membership. Yes, everyone could play all the levels before, and now it&#39;s just for members. Top weird decisions of the CP team, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/bitsbolts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bits &amp;amp; Bolts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My least favorite of the trio was 2011&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Bits &amp;amp; Bolts&lt;/strong&gt;, the last arcade machine released in CP. The idea was being a math game, when you had a target number and you had to count how many bolts were in the tiles and click on them until you have the sum equal to the target. &lt;strong&gt;I made it look a boring Tetris-like? Because it was.&lt;/strong&gt; At least, the visuals were really cute and nice (I love a good orange and blue palette well used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;22) Astro Barrier&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the arcade journey, 2005&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Astro Barrier&lt;/strong&gt; has a really cool concept (specially for one of the first five minigames in CP history). It was inspired by old arcade shooters, but transformed as &lt;strong&gt;a puzzle that required forward thinking and precision&lt;/strong&gt;. In each level, you had only one shot per target and if you successfully shot a target, it would freeze and becoming an obstacle to avoid further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/astrobarrier.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Astro Barrier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what didn&#39;t click for me was, essentially, the arcade vibe of it. Not visually, but the idea of losing all your lives and restarting from the beginning. Some levels were really hard and &lt;strong&gt;could be frustrating&lt;/strong&gt;. But the staff at the time was thinking of it and blocked all but the first 10 levels to non-members, so I didn&#39;t had this problem anymore. And I also didn&#39;t played Astro Barrier anymore, but it was only a detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;21) Thin Ice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best Club Penguin arcade for me, though, was &lt;strong&gt;Thin Ice&lt;/strong&gt;! Released in 2006 (and featuring the first CP original song composed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq5fzzf6lX5SF3h8FV5VpSxqQrWIoydTz&quot;&gt;legendary Chris Hendricks/Screenhog&lt;/a&gt;), your goal was to move a flaming black puffle through ice levels, melting the ice with each move. It was way inspired by those &lt;strong&gt;one-line puzzles&lt;/strong&gt;, when you have to find a path that can go through all the board without repeating a tile or getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/thinice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thin Ice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things made this game so far in the ranking, one is the already mentioned &lt;strong&gt;decision to lock 50% of the game behind a paid membership&lt;/strong&gt; — I really loved playing Thin Ice so it was a bit of a bummer to me. The other thing was the really open levels, that just consisted of moving the puffle in a big square for so much longer that it needed, and then discover you messed up. Not great, but in good stages, it was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Someone needed to do a spiritual successor to Thin Ice. Maybe I can do that...?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;20) Catchin&#39; Waves&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even the best surfing game on Club Penguin, &lt;strong&gt;Catchin&#39; Waves&lt;/strong&gt; was released on 2007 and became the great attraction of the Cove until the closing. You get a surfboard and go surf through waves, doing tricks and just surviving. There was a tutorial mode, a freestyle arcade mode and other, more difficult modes that asks for more control of the penguin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/catchingwaves.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Catchin&#39; Waves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why the game exists, surfing is cool and radical, and we are cool children! But the execution was not very good: &lt;strong&gt;the controls were always strange to me&lt;/strong&gt;, they didn&#39;t make sense and were way too slippery. It was never my choice to play during my time online, and I didn&#39;t even care too much when they also locked half of the game behind the paid membership. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;19) Puffle Roundup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puffle Roundup&lt;/strong&gt; was always one of the most strange minigames for me. It was released in 2005, during the first year of Club Penguin, and then it &lt;strong&gt;looked like a first-year activity forever&lt;/strong&gt;. Your goal was to &lt;strong&gt;push puffles into a pen&lt;/strong&gt; using the mouse, while the pets run away from the cursor in a chaotic way. If you get all of the them until the time goes out, you win and start a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/roundup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Puffle Roundup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played it some times even after years of Club Penguin, but it&#39;s so fun to be just a simple game, with simpler graphics, in a platform that tried to be bigger each year. They even updated it with new puffle colors when they were released! Not an incredible game, but it was for me like &lt;strong&gt;a small piece of history in an avalanche of change&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;18) Jet Pack Adventure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t like it that much, but I can&#39;t deny how iconic &lt;strong&gt;Jet Pack Adventure&lt;/strong&gt; is to Club Penguin. Launched in 2006, your goal was to &lt;strong&gt;get a jet pack&lt;/strong&gt; at the top of the Beacon and use it to &lt;strong&gt;travel until the Mine&lt;/strong&gt;, at the other side of the island, getting coins in the process. Avoiding all the obstacles was the real challenge and the reason why I failed it so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/jetpack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jet Pack Adventure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t one of my favorites (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7e8ISJvVp70?t=10&quot;&gt;I prefer the DS version&lt;/a&gt; because of the touch controls) and they also &lt;strong&gt;blocked FOUR LEVELS OUT OF FIVE&lt;/strong&gt; behind the paid membership in 2010... but it was interesting and fitted well with Club Penguin&#39;s vibe and lore. I always loved that you lose the game before the ending, you came back to the game in the room you were flying over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;17) Puffle Rescue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first on a new trilogy of &amp;quot;puffle minigames&amp;quot;, &lt;strong&gt;Puffle Rescue&lt;/strong&gt; was launched in 2010 and could be found inside the Mine. The basis of it is being a Frogger semi-clone: you &lt;strong&gt;navigate grid-like mazes, dodging obstacles and trying to get to the puffles&lt;/strong&gt; at the other side to rescue them. Three modes existed (but two of them were members-only): rescuing blue puffles in frozen water, pink puffles inside dangerous caves and black puffles underwater, at risk of drowning. At least, this time, they don&#39;t removed free content: pink and black levels were always paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/pufflerescue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Puffle Rescue&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember fondly how Puffle Rescue was the &lt;strong&gt;first Club Penguin thing that couldn&#39;t run well in my old computer&lt;/strong&gt; at the time (just like Card-Jitsu Snow). They were starting the &amp;quot;next generation&amp;quot; at the time, that would implicate in a totally art style in the next years. This minigame was the first that I remember looking and having a strange feeling about it because of more modernized (and less Flash) visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the game, the &lt;strong&gt;free levels were fine&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&#39;t love the Frogger mechanic, but it worked well with the rescuing theme. And you could &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Underwater&quot;&gt;unlock a secret room during the game&lt;/a&gt;, so, it was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;16) Hydro Hopper&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our third original CP game in this list, &lt;strong&gt;Hydro Hopper&lt;/strong&gt; is way older than even the first Club Penguin prototypes ever created. &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Hydro_Hopper#History&quot;&gt;According to the Club Penguin Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, it was the first Flash game ever made by Lance Priebe (CP&#39;s co-founder), that named it originally as Ballistic Biscuit, a way funnier title! Your goal is to &lt;strong&gt;maintain your penguin being pushed by a motorboat&lt;/strong&gt;, avoiding increasing obstacles by moving and jumping with the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/hydrohopper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hydro Hopper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Puffle Roundup, &lt;strong&gt;it&#39;s easy to know how old the game&lt;/strong&gt; was, even looking nowadays. The Flash sketchy graphics, the simplicity of the gameplay, the silly jokes between levels... It wasn&#39;t bad, I don&#39;t played it that often, but ended up being overshadowed by a whole list of more interesting experiences that came after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;15) Card-Jitsu Water&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish the Card-Jitsu spin-off trilogy, let&#39;s talk about my favorite of the bunch: &lt;strong&gt;Card-Jitsu Water&lt;/strong&gt;, released in 2010. Mixing the board game motif from Fire and the video game inspiration we would see fully in Snow, Water is a &lt;strong&gt;real-time race tabletop-like game&lt;/strong&gt;. Stone tiles with elemental obstacles would be floating down a waterfall, and the goal was to use Card-Jitsu cards to remove the obstacles and be the last penguin standing (or the first to play the gongo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/cardjitsu-water.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Card-Jitsu Water&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the more demanding graphics, this game was fun! Maybe it was just the Stockholm syndrome attacking again (I also played this a lot in that 2011 party), but &lt;strong&gt;the concept of actually using the cards for something new&lt;/strong&gt; made sense. The idea of having the game on a waterfall was well used too, instead of being just a thematic background. I wish the interaction between players were more easy to plan, but it was, easily, the best ninja game after the original Card-Jitsu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, it was only for members for a long time and I would have got more nostalgia for it without this limitation. So, 15th is a good place for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;14) Spy Drills&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing more epic than ninjas in Club Penguin are &lt;strong&gt;secret agents&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are familiar with post-2010 CP, you can remember the &lt;strong&gt;Elite Penguin Force&lt;/strong&gt; (EPF), the current special agency responsible to protect the island and keep it safe. Although it was created for &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Club_Penguin:_Elite_Penguin_Force&quot;&gt;a Nintendo DS game&lt;/a&gt; two years prior, they became an integral part of the main game, including their own minigames!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/spydrills1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Navigator in Spy Drills&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, EPF agents could participate in an activity called &lt;strong&gt;Field-Ops&lt;/strong&gt;. Each week, they would receive a message in their spy phones, hinting a particular location in an actual Club Penguin room. When their penguin found the place, the phone would react and &lt;strong&gt;unlock a sci-fi, hacking-like microgame&lt;/strong&gt;. Winning the game would gave resources for unlocking secret agent clothes and items. For lore reasons, the Field-Ops ended in late 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in the next year, they came back from the dead in the form of an actual minigame at the EPF Command Room: &lt;strong&gt;Spy Drills&lt;/strong&gt;! Instead of the weekly location hunt, all the microgames were now available in only one interface, like a common Club Penguin minigame. You could choose one to train it, or go to a Challenge, trying to beat three in a row without failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/spydrills2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Code Break in Spy Drills&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made them sound way cooler than they really was... Some of them were actually interesting, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/The_Navigator&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Navigator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — that asks you to program commands to beat a maze — or &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Code_Break&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Break&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a simple but competent Mastermind clone. But at the same time, you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Circuit_Match&quot;&gt;a memory game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Tumblers&quot;&gt;a mathematical angle quiz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Rhythm_Lock&quot;&gt;a rhythmic Simon Says&lt;/a&gt; and other simple things. I liked it more as Field-Ops than Spy Drills itself, but I like the recycling process! Content is content, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;13) Treasure Hunt&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when I said that party minigames would not be in the list? &lt;strong&gt;Treasure Hunt&lt;/strong&gt; is the exception to the rule, because it was just available during some parts of the year since 2008. Specifically, this game was played in the &lt;strong&gt;Captain&#39;s Quarters of the Migrator&lt;/strong&gt;, the pirate ship commanded by Rockhopper, one of the most important NPCs in Club Penguin. He would dock in the island multiple times a year (mostly during parties), bringing exclusive items and this minigame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/treasurehunt1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasure Hunt&lt;/strong&gt; was a 2-player, cooperative board game about &lt;strong&gt;dig treasures in a grid covered by sand&lt;/strong&gt;. A player would only uncover rows in the grid and the other player, only columns. The whole thing about the game is that each grid space had TWO layers of sand; i.e. a thing could only be fully found &lt;strong&gt;if both players coordinate their actions&lt;/strong&gt; to uncover the same square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common treasures were 1x1 simple coins, but 2x2 rubies (and even emeralds) could be also found. The players needed to pay attention to shiny symbols when uncovering the first sand layer: this would indicate something was there, at least a coin. &lt;strong&gt;In Christmas, they even changed the game visuals&lt;/strong&gt;, swapping sand by snow and the treasures by holiday candies and ornaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/treasurehunt2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Treasure Hunt at Christmas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always liked to play some games of Treasure Hunt, probably because of its sporadic nature and being always a &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; thing to try during an event. But there wasn&#39;t a lot of coins to get from it, and the game was &lt;strong&gt;heavily based on luck and your partner&#39;s moves&lt;/strong&gt;, so it was easy to get bad games just because you (or worse, the other person) tried the wrong lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;12) Mancala&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we got to games that I really liked to play in Club Penguin and I miss every time I remember of my beloved island. And, yes, I loved to play &lt;strong&gt;Mancala&lt;/strong&gt; in the Book Room back in the day. Giving you the context that I didn&#39;t have at the time, mancala is, actually, a really old game. Like, history date the first mancala boards to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala&quot;&gt;700 AD&#39;s East Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Although variations and variations of the game are part of cultures around the world, Brazil was not one of those countries... so &lt;strong&gt;I discovered this ancient game through a Flash children MMO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/mancala.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mancala&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, indeed, &lt;strong&gt;a fun game!&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the versions (including CP&#39;s Mancala) is played by two people competitively, moving their pieces in a circular board, trying to capture more pieces than the opponent. The key mechanic of a mancala game (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2955/mancala&quot;&gt;used in a lot of modern board games&lt;/a&gt;) is &lt;strong&gt;sewing&lt;/strong&gt;: you get all the pieces on a space in your side of the board and start distributing then in the next spaces in order, one at a time. Depending where you place the last piece, you can do different actions, like capturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mancala was &lt;strong&gt;one of the five first games on Club Penguin&lt;/strong&gt; and I&#39;m really glad they put it in. If they have chosen any other classic game, like checkers or chess, I would probably have ignored it for years. But when they can introduce a child to a special part of another culture inside a cartoon penguin simulator, it has a great impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;11) Smoothie Smash&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothie Smash&lt;/strong&gt; was one of the games that I liked to play, but couldn&#39;t play much at the time. Released in 2012 at the Coffee Shop, it was the last minigame truly original to be introduced in the original Club Penguin (after that, we only had an EPF game, a ninja game and SoundStudio). The concept here was to &lt;strong&gt;create smoothies bouncing with your penguin butt in fruits&lt;/strong&gt; that were passing in a conveyor belt. At the bottom of the screen, a customer would show what fruits you needed to &amp;quot;smash&amp;quot; and in what order to increase your combo. Even a survival mode with obstacles was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/smoothie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smoothie Smash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I need to recognize that &lt;strong&gt;ALL THE EXPERIENCE HERE WAS FREE&lt;/strong&gt;. It was the ONLY GAME in years to be released with all content for free and paid members, and it was just cool. Thank you, gang! Second, it was also one of the newest games, so my computer couldn&#39;t handle it very well... In a mechanic of rapid thinking and combos, it wasn&#39;t a good match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I played Smoothie Smash some years ago in private servers and it was genuinely fun. Trying to &lt;strong&gt;find the next fruit to bounce without losing the combo&lt;/strong&gt;, trying to catch extra time, it was a blast! I would love to see this concept revisited by someone, including new mechanics in the mix (!) to make the experience more interesting after some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;10) System Defender&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I could imagine a lot of ideas for the first, exclusive EPF minigame... but I could never guess it was a tower defense. &lt;strong&gt;System Defender&lt;/strong&gt; was launched in 2011 as the &lt;strong&gt;first storyline in EPF in-game lore&lt;/strong&gt;, and could only be accessed in the EPF Command Room by secret agents. The idea was to simulate a defense system for the agency computers, using an almost cyberpunk aesthetic. In each level, your goal was help EPF agents to &lt;strong&gt;destroy bots that are trying to corrupt the EPF Mainframe&lt;/strong&gt; using special tech cannons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/defender.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;System Defender&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way I can describe System Defender is &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;your first tower defense game&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. You only had three types of cannons/&amp;quot;towers&amp;quot;, three types of enemies and the bosses were just bigger robots. Energy was the main (and only) resource that could be used to build new cannons or pay high for a upgrade cog. They were even &lt;strong&gt;color-coded to help understand the synergy&lt;/strong&gt;: the red cannon/robot had average stats, the yellow ones were faster and the purple ones were slow (but more powerful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked to play this game back in the day, even with half of the levels behind the paid membership. Secret agent things were my favorite at Club Penguin, and &lt;strong&gt;having the characters talking and discussing the attacks&lt;/strong&gt; during the matches was the cherry at the top. My only problem is my completely incapacity of playing tower defense games, so I didn&#39;t finished most of the levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;09) Aqua Grabber&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2008 in a event to rescue the parts of Rockhopper&#39;s ship when it collided with an iceberg, &lt;strong&gt;Aqua Grabber&lt;/strong&gt; is, to me, one of the most complete mini-games in Club Penguin. Your goal is to &lt;strong&gt;use a submarine to navigate the seas&lt;/strong&gt; under the island to get treasures, controlling the air inside it. Although a lot of levels were planned, only two were actually released (and one of them was also money-blocked in the 2010), what is a shame, because it had a lot of potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/aquagrabber.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aqua Grabber&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;exploration factor of Aqua Grabber&lt;/strong&gt; was the best for me, with different objectives and ways to explore the same level. The gameplay was simple, but the controls were well made. I remember trying for hours to get a secret bigger fish in one of the levels, because you needed to get a secret bait, and then get a smaller fish, and then try to &amp;quot;catch&amp;quot; the big fish. Even for not-secret goals, there was some puzzles involved. I really wanted more of Aqua Grabber...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;08) Pufflescape&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 (at the middle of my CP frenzy as a child), they started &lt;strong&gt;a Beta Team feature in Club Penguin&#39;s website&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea was to test features and minigames in a prototype phase together with the community. I played most of them at the time, and the only one I could remember of liking was Rollerscape, a &lt;strong&gt;puzzle-platformer&lt;/strong&gt; featuring the recent discovered white puffles. Your goal was to control it inside a rolling ball to &lt;strong&gt;get all the berries in a ice maze&lt;/strong&gt;. You could even use the mouse to open/close obstacles, or use the puffle to push boxes and open new paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/pufflescape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pufflescape&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this was the ONLY thing that was actually was put in the game coming from the beta features! Now renamed &lt;strong&gt;Pufflescape&lt;/strong&gt; (and part of the &amp;quot;puffle trilogy&amp;quot;) and featuring any of the player&#39;s puffles if they wanted, it was really fun! The extra levels were only available for paid members, but I played them on private servers over the years and they had cool designs too. Some of them needed more polish, but for a CP minigame, they found a formula that worked. Another one that I could get a spiritual successor easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;07) Card-Jitsu&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the end of our &lt;strong&gt;ninja journey&lt;/strong&gt; is the beginning. Released in 2008 and making everyone really cares for the not-secret-anymore Dojo, the original &lt;strong&gt;Card-Jitsu&lt;/strong&gt; was a &lt;strong&gt;2-player competitive card game&lt;/strong&gt; inside (and outside) Club Penguin. As I mentioned, during the turn, each player would choose a card with an element and a power value, and they would win or lose in a &lt;strong&gt;rock-paper-scissors fashion&lt;/strong&gt;: fire melts snow, snow freezes water, water puts out fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/cardjitsu1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Card-Jitsu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes it for me more interesting than your more common trumps games is how &lt;strong&gt;you would win a game of Card-Jitsu&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of just winning a certain number of turns, each card also had a border color. To win, you needed to get three cards of the same element or one card of each element, but &lt;strong&gt;IN DIFFERENT BORDER COLORS&lt;/strong&gt;. It wasn&#39;t the greatest strategic game ever made, but this detail helped to allow interesting decisions instead of just playing your powerful card in hand every turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Cards&lt;/strong&gt; also were an important part of Card-Jitsu: they were really powerful, had original, exclusive animations and &lt;strong&gt;rules that affected the game&lt;/strong&gt;, like blocking an element in the next turn, or making lower values win elemental ties (instead of higher). The only problem here is how you unlocked new cards during some years: you needed to buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Club_Penguin_Trading_Cards&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actual, physical Card-Jitsu collection cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and use codes to unlock their digital versions. It was a little frustrating to play against an American child with money and see their collection of Power Cards...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/cardjitsu2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aunt Arctic Power Card in Card-Jitsu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all that, Card-Jitsu was really fun! The &lt;strong&gt;progression in your &amp;quot;ninja journey&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, getting colored belts like some real martial arts, was engaging and a cool way to show your mastery to other penguins. To became a real ninja, you needed to beat the CPU in the form of Sensei, a really hard card duel. It was so successful that I understand why three spin-offs were released after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;06) Cart Surfer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now THIS is the &lt;strong&gt;best surfing activity&lt;/strong&gt; in Club Penguin. Forget the water and go to the Mine, because &lt;strong&gt;Cart Surfer&lt;/strong&gt; was always fun. Your penguin just go on a cart mine and your goal is to &lt;strong&gt;do a lot of tricks to get points&lt;/strong&gt;, combos and coins. Released in 2006, it felt as a simple game (because it was), but has all the things that made Flash games addicting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/cartsurfer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cart Surfer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had a easy game loop to understand, and less courageous people could just turn and finish the game without going after a lot of tricks. But understanding the 10+ tricks available, when do them to maximize the points and not crashing at the same time... uh, it was good! My favorite was Cart Grind, that you could do instead of turning. &lt;strong&gt;Simple, but effective:&lt;/strong&gt; Cart Surfer deserves a spiritual successor too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;05) Bean Counters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our top five starts again in the Coffee Shop for the last Club Penguin original game for the list. &lt;strong&gt;Bean Counters&lt;/strong&gt; released in 2005 as an action-focused minigame, where your goal was to catch coffee bean bags being launched from a truck and stack them to restock the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/bean.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bean Counters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, anvils, fishes and other strange obstacles would also be launched and needed to be avoided. If you stack a lot of bags in your penguin without unload them in the shop, you would also lose a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Cart Surfer, it had this Flash game vibes with a simple gameplay and visuals, but it was &lt;strong&gt;really well executed&lt;/strong&gt;. Using the mouse to move the penguin made it respond well in harder levels, when they are so much things at the screen. And I would love to have this same mechanic in a more intricate game, with more challenge instead of just catching the same bag...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...BUT WE HAVE. Bean Counters is one of the two only minigames in Club Penguin to have a &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;candy secret variant&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, activated finding a special button in the title screen. Introduced in 2011, &lt;strong&gt;Jellybean Counters&lt;/strong&gt; have the bags full of colored jellybeans instead of coffee. Instead of just stacking them, you have to pay attention to the right colors too! Putting the wrong jellybeans in the stack would make you lose a life. This version was not that accessible (for colorblind people), but it was my preferred way to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/jellybean.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jellybean Counters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;04) Pizzatron 3000&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name a more iconic Club Penguin minigame than &lt;strong&gt;Pizzatron 3000&lt;/strong&gt;. I&#39;m not gonna wait because you can&#39;t name a more iconic CP activity. The &lt;strong&gt;heart of Pizza Parlor&lt;/strong&gt; since 2007, this was always a blast to play (and SO HARD OH MY GOD). Empty pizzas were passing through a conveyor belt and you had to run with your mouse putting all the toppings correctly, following the recipe at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/pizzatron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pizzatron 3000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to explain why this minigame was so cool, because it is a little too simple in concept. But after the 10th pizza, &lt;strong&gt;the belt starts to accelerate&lt;/strong&gt; and you just ignore everything around you to get five squids and hot sauce in some seconds. It was really hard to finish everything without mistakes, but the fun is to try. Doing no mistakes would reward tips and more coins at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even harder is the &lt;strong&gt;Candytron 3000&lt;/strong&gt;, the another CP&#39;s secret candy variation (in fact, this one came first). Activated in a hidden lever in the title screen, the machine starts making sweet pizzas, with chocolate, marshmallows and jelly beans. It was faster, but more rewarding. I never did a perfect game on the candy mode, however. One day, wko knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;03) Puffle Launch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I&#39;ve been harsh about minigames with content locked behind the paid membership... but &lt;strong&gt;Puffle Launch&lt;/strong&gt; was too cool to not be in the top 3. Launched in 2011, it&#39;s our last game of the &amp;quot;puffle trilogy&amp;quot; and one of the best ever made on Club Penguin. A red puffle want to recover all the berries stolen by Klutzy the Crab and is going fully radical to it: using cannons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/launch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Puffle Launch App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy way to explain is imagining a level full of those Donkey Kong Country barrels (that launch you in a direction), but with &lt;strong&gt;free air movement&lt;/strong&gt;! When flying, you can change the trajectory of the red puffle, so you can do a lot of cool tricks bouncing in the obstacles. &lt;strong&gt;There&#39;s no place in a level you can reach with enough momentum and control mastery.&lt;/strong&gt; And they know it, because there are a lot of berries on stupid locations, outside the main path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Puffle Launch is one of the only Club Penguin minigames that could be its own game and be an amazing package. Yes, it&#39;s foreshadowing again, because the game was released as the &lt;strong&gt;first CP mobile app&lt;/strong&gt; later that year. In fact, that&#39;s how I started to love it! In 2022, I found an APK to the (now delisted) app and mastered it. It was an literal blast and I just wanted to play more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Someone MUST to do a spiritual successor to Puffle Launch. Maybe I have to do that...?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;02) PSA Secret Missions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I need to chose one thing to prove how fun and incredible was the secret agent content in Club Penguin, this (not mini)game would be it. Way before the EPF, there was the PSA, the Penguin Secret Agency. As old as the island itself, penguins could enlist to be a special agent and maintain the order. But, in 2006, everything change with the launch of the first &lt;strong&gt;PSA Secret Mission&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/psa1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PSA Mission 6: Questions for a Crab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of in-game events with little puzzles like the EPF had years after, &lt;strong&gt;all the PSA Secret Missions were point-and-click games!&lt;/strong&gt; Looking into rooms, searching for items, solving puzzles, talking to other characters: Club Penguin did its own Monkey Island, in a smaller scale, of course. The agents even had their secret way of communicate in the form of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Tic-Tac-Toe_Code&quot;&gt;Tic-Tac-Toe Code&lt;/a&gt;, also used for puzzles during the missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the heavy focus on story and plot of the genre, the &lt;strong&gt;lore behind the PSA&lt;/strong&gt; and its agents were, for a lot of time, the &lt;strong&gt;most detailed part of Club Penguin&lt;/strong&gt;. It was the first time we would be introduced to iconic characters, like the PSA scientist Gary the Gadget Guy — and even CP&#39;s own great evil, Herbert P. Bear, a polar bear destined to destroy the island at any costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/psa2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PSA Mission 1: Case Of The Missing Puffles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten missions were released from 2006 to 2008&lt;/strong&gt;, mostly focusing them on your start as a secret agent and the first attacks from Herbert. &lt;strong&gt;In 2010, the awaited Mission 11&lt;/strong&gt; was released as &amp;quot;The Veggie Villain&amp;quot;, that resulted in a big impact in-game. No spoilers, but this was the last mission of the PSA, and after that, the EPF assumed the role of island protectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those missions were so different and well made they even &lt;strong&gt;inspired two Nintendo DS games&lt;/strong&gt; made in the Club Penguin franchise. The second one, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Club_Penguin:_Elite_Penguin_Force:_Herbert%27s_Revenge&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force: Herbert&#39;s Revenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was literally based on the PSA missions: &lt;strong&gt;more than half of the game are just ports&lt;/strong&gt; of the original PSA missions. I always find that really lame, but now, with the original CP popped out of existence, it&#39;s probably the most accessible way to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;01) Ice Fishing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when I said this list was deeply personal? The PSA Missions were, by far, the coolest minigame in Club Penguin history... but if there is one that I played more than any others, it&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Ice Fishing&lt;/strong&gt;. Released in 2006 for the Ski Lodge, &lt;strong&gt;it was my favorite CP minigame&lt;/strong&gt; and I even can&#39;t explain why!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal was really simple: &lt;strong&gt;just fish&lt;/strong&gt;. You could move your mouse up and down to catch the fish with your hook, and then click outside the water to remove the prey. Obstacles would appear to make you lose baits (your lives), and they would keep coming during 5 levels of difficulty. At the end, if you were smart, you &lt;strong&gt;could use a normal fish as bait for Mullet&lt;/strong&gt;, the big boy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/club-penguin-minigame-ranking/icefishing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ice Fishing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had that &lt;strong&gt;Flash game vibe so right&lt;/strong&gt;, and it was so responsive to play. After some years playing it, I could do a lot of almost &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; with the line, &lt;strong&gt;catching a lot of the fish in situations that seemed impossible&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2008, a members-only special fishing pole could be acquired, and harder gray fish would also appear. Fortunately, in my private server years, I could also play with them, and I love it. &lt;strong&gt;Ice Fishing is just so cool&lt;/strong&gt;, and I would pay for a game that replicate that same feeling nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot, huh? If you played Club Penguin at some point in your life, I hope to have &lt;strong&gt;helped you navigate in memories&lt;/strong&gt;, remembering the cool times in that loved island. And if you never played CP in your life and just read until here out of pure morbid curiosity... it&#39;s impressive and scary how much content a 2000s Flash online game for children could have, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk more about CP in the future (because I miss it so much), but that&#39;s it for now. Happy Christmas for you, your family and our penguins. &lt;strong&gt;Waddle on!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why creating a blog helped me find a digital identity</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/why-i-created-this-blog.html"/>
    <updated>2023-12-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/why-i-created-this-blog.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, I finished a project that lasted a few months in my hands: I finally have a &lt;strong&gt;new, made-from-scratch blog / portfolio&lt;/strong&gt; for all gaming and writing things that I love to do as a hobby. Yes, it&#39;s simple, there is no ads (and never will be), but I made it as my little space in the web and I&#39;m really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I look to the web around me, a old-fashioned collection of texts seems way off? &lt;strong&gt;The internet nowadays is more of a never-sleeping market&lt;/strong&gt;, whose main products are your screen time and your data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/subway-surfers-tiktok-corecore-video-collage-psychology-1850061976&quot;&gt;Short videos need Subway Surfers gameplay&lt;/a&gt; so people can actually pay attention. A Google search is more of a minefield and you probably get what you want in the page 3, what would be unbelievable some years ago. And, of course, the constant thought of &amp;quot;is this made by an stealing-content AI?&amp;quot; will be asked forever until the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to see people discussing about how this late capitalism stage we live on forces you to transform your hobbies into business and work... but the Web is so strange that, sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;engagement is way more valuable than money&lt;/strong&gt;. Win the social media algorithms just to connect to people, even if you don&#39;t want to make profit from it, is obligatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&#39;t impress me how much closed spaces are becoming for communities everywhere. If you wanted to find a place to talk about a subject some years ago, you would probably find an open, searchable forum, or even a e-mail group. Today, the best you can find is a Telegram group or a Discord server, that will be lost forever as soon as these companies go bankrupt in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t take so many months to program a simple blog. I really did it in one month, including a lot of the new articles. All of this time was &lt;strong&gt;trying to understand why I&#39;m on the internet&lt;/strong&gt;. I never really remember a time in my history that I wasn&#39;t online, but what this means to my adult self? Why bother to craft a special space for me in the middle of digital hell? This is the result of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Born with an e-mail account&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in August 1998 in a countryside city in Brazil. According to scientists &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillennials&quot;&gt;(and Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m a Zillenial&lt;/strong&gt;: mostly I have dual citizenship in both generations and I&#39;m both allowed to appeal to nostalgia AND be asked to fix my aunt&#39;s Instagram account. The tiny difference here is, when most of Gen Z started their lives with a mobile phone, I learned to type in a desktop keyboard before writing on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always get sad when I said that I never had cable TV or a video game console during my childhood, but &lt;strong&gt;I was really privileged to have access to computers and internet since I was born&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, it was a old computer with Windows 98 and a dial-up connection to be used only in weekends, but this is my oldest memory that I can remember. Me, as a toddler, sitting in a high chair, looking at my dad using the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/why-i-created-this-blog/win98.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Windows 98&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way or another, &lt;strong&gt;I grew up with the Web&lt;/strong&gt;. When I was a little child, I got my first e-mail address, learned how to create account on sites for children. Every weekend, when I logged the web, the first thing I was obligated to do was download the Norton Antivirus update for my dad. I loved to browse freeware download portals, because I would love new games and applications to experiment during the week. It was also my first time experimenting with web page design: I used GeoCities, I just tried Microsoft FrontPage non-stop like it was MS Paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a time that everything on the web was static websites and the only thing that a viewer could change was a visitor counter, a world where your Favorites browser folder was a treasure to be saved for generations. A time when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGuYtUkaIw&quot;&gt;a famous Brazilian TV host could try a musical career and his flagship song could be having virtual friends&lt;/a&gt;. If I was older, I would probably would been a IRC user, but the only thing burned in my mind is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iCPIUGnHQ8&quot;&gt;my dad&#39;s ICQ notification sound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/why-i-created-this-blog/oldblogs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;(some old sites that I had during the years, from top to bottom, left to right: (1) my first GeoCities website that I did with my dad circa 2004; (2) my most serious attempt to create a humor blog in 2011; (3) the rebranding I did for the same site on 2012; (4) a portfolio link aggregator that I did in 2016 when tried to be a freelance writer)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(some old sites that I had during the years, from top to bottom, left to right: (1) my first GeoCities website that I did with my dad circa 2004; (2) my most serious attempt to create a humor blog in 2011; (3) the rebranding I did for the same site on 2012, drawing by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitsujii.com/&quot;&gt;Mitsujii&lt;/a&gt;; (4) a portfolio link aggregator that I did in 2016 when I tried to be a freelance writer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, the internet started to change, and me too. As I started to enter my teenage years, the Web 2.0 started to really becoming a reality. I remember photo sharing sites becoming famous (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fotolog&quot;&gt;Fotolog&lt;/a&gt;, really famous on Brazil), and then the social media started to appear. I know that MySpace was the hot thing overseas, but here in my country, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut&quot;&gt;we LOVED &lt;strong&gt;Orkut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Did you know that for some time, Orkut was only really used by Brazil and India, and all the operations for the site have gone to Google Brazil? Even now, for most millenials, that pink logo is THE symbol of our 2000s Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, and then, &lt;strong&gt;everything happened!?&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook starts taking over everything, YouTube gets a lot of traction and makes video sharing a true reality, Twitter just explodes and became the new sensation. During this process for us in Brazil, Orkut was really famous yet, and there&#39;s a lot of humor blogs, just creating first-generation memes and reposting cool videos from other humor blogs. I tried a lot to be part of this, maybe with a dozen different blogs and some YouTube channels. No, you cannot watch my teenager vlogs or I&#39;ll need to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/why-i-created-this-blog/orkut.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orkut&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I really lived in the internet all of this time. If it was healthy, I can&#39;t say, but I definitely did. Most of my hobbies at the time was doing something in the computer, probably on the web. My favorite game as a child was Club Penguin! It&#39;s strange that children nowadays just are born with a smartphone in the hands — and I had a similar, but so different infancy. That&#39;s why finding my way on the internet is not just doing a hobby or creating an account: &lt;strong&gt;the Web is a integral part of my history, and my online persona is an important part of me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Finding a digital identity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this time, I was just a kid with internet access doing kid stuff. Trying things, copying the trends. I never had any success or fame, probably because I was literally copying the blogs I read or the vlogs I watched. But starting in 2011-2012, I started writing about games for real in the Web, &lt;strong&gt;on sites way bigger (and more successful) than anything that I could do alone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for years, I never stopped (all of them are in Portuguese, but if you want, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/#projects&quot;&gt;I listed them as part of my project list&lt;/a&gt;). I started to get some followers in social media just because I was writing about games in a medium-size portal, and that was it. It was, at least, original articles! (Progress!) I was in high school during this period, and the internet was already algorithmic and more centralized from what I used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, &lt;strong&gt;creating a thing by myself became a stupid idea, you know?&lt;/strong&gt; Why bother to start from zero when I can just write in other people&#39;s spaces? That little amount of visibility — that I never had until that point — was enough to fuel my impostor syndrome. No one would follow what a stupid boy like me, I was just lucky to get a way to write and be known about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, at the same time, I was starting my major in Computer Science. I&#39;m really grateful that my university was public (and public colleges in Brazil are free for students), but I needed some money to get food and a place to live in a bigger city. Writing became also a way to help my parents to pay the bills and try to get a diploma at the end of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a matter of years, &lt;strong&gt;that little child that sees the internet as an infinite playground was gone&lt;/strong&gt;. I was just a recent-promoted-to-adulthood human being, worrying about money and entering in a spiral of low self esteem and burnout. I got some bucks doing copywriting for enterprise blogs and a really clickbait-y mobile app portal, but it was this. In some months, I started doing research and getting some money for that, and then getting a job as a web developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, I think I never understood what I want from the internet anymore. Besides like, being a &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; (but chronically online) user. For a person that created stupid projects in a monthly basis, it&#39;s a little sad. I know that, well, I was an adult now, with a job, responsibilities and mental fatigue, but something was missing. &lt;strong&gt;My internet persona was missing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/why-i-created-this-blog/essentia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;one of my old board game prototypes that I failed to develop fully&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(one of my old board game prototypes that I failed to develop fully)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept writing for a lot of different portals, writing alongside really talented people, but I never was really happy with what I was doing? &lt;strong&gt;In just some months, it always became a mechanical, soulless job that I was doing for free to someone.&lt;/strong&gt; Even when I tried to be a &amp;quot;board game designer&amp;quot; for real during the pandemic, I started almost a double work shift and the impostor syndrome attacked in the first refusal from a publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this domain name, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/&quot;&gt;gabtoschi.com&lt;/a&gt;, was already home for three or four different websites in just a couple of years. I woke up and decided that a new blog will solve my creative problem. In a week, I had found a template in Google, modified some CSS and called it a day. Never updated or wrote anything until the next epiphany. Ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up with the internet taught me how unhealthy was transform all of your feelings and opinions in social media big data. I simply can&#39;t share everything that I am as tweets or stories, it doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Somehow, I need to find who I want to be in the internet, what my creative outlet would be. In some ways, &lt;strong&gt;I want back the innocence, courage, sincerity and trust in my own ideas like I had as a child.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My new cozy webplace&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in my intimate reflection, you understand what I decided that would be my creative outlet. &lt;strong&gt;This website, made from scratch, by myself&lt;/strong&gt; (with a great help from my wife). No more templates (for the site and for me). This whole text isn&#39;t just about to present it to you, but remind me why I had this in my mind for so many months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of &lt;strong&gt;creating a internet persona, for real&lt;/strong&gt;. A version of me that I&#39;m comfortable to be public and forever preserved on the Internet Archive (or a Russian database). I feel safer because my life and my family is preserved, and I can be connected with people all around the world from my home. That TV show host wasn&#39;t that far away, if you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that was really clear to me was understand that the &lt;strong&gt;internet is a hobby, and not a job&lt;/strong&gt;. I already have a job — that is creating internet pages, don&#39;t even start to argument. Doing those things needs to be just for fun, to be silly, and not another pressure to get results, or engagement, or profit. I already have a lot of capitalism in my head every day, and I cannot choose (again) to have more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why?&lt;/strong&gt; This was getting me for real. If not to be famous, or getting money, why create a blog to write nowadays? If I want just to put something out from me, I can talk to myself in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized the only thing that the Web never failed to me: &lt;strong&gt;getting people together&lt;/strong&gt;. I have friends that I talk monthly (at least) for a DECADE. Some of them I would invite for my marriage (and I actually did). There&#39;s some people that I meet through messages and video calls that are more next to me than most of the kids I studied together, every day, for 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, &lt;strong&gt;I will create a blog to talk about things that I like and find other people that also likes those things&lt;/strong&gt;. I would love to have someone to talk, in detail, what is the better Club Penguin minigame, or how interesting is this Nintendo DS hidden gem only released in Japan. Or even, something that I already did a lot in other outlets, just talk about good games and help other people to find them! That&#39;s a nice goal, and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that &lt;strong&gt;writing is a good way to outlet ideas for me, personally&lt;/strong&gt;. Not just because I do this for 10 years now, and I&#39;m mostly comfortable to do so. But because I&#39;m the master of starting projects, losing the heat and stopping them completely. If I can, at least, write about my attempt, maybe I can have more of the personal satisfaction that I&#39;m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, it&#39;s so good to not be attached to a big company&#39;s platform nowadays. Yes, I&#39;ll probably need social media to find these people, but I don&#39;t need to worry that YouTube will delete my channel when I&#39;m sleeping. Or that a social network that I could have invested time and effort would be bought by a stupid person and starting to crumble in front of my eyes. &lt;strong&gt;My content, my space, my control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s so fun that, for so much time, I was looking for a way to describe my internet persona. A web developer? A gaming-related writer? A game designer? And then I found three words: &lt;strong&gt;curiosity, creativity and chaos&lt;/strong&gt;. Doesn&#39;t matter exactly what I&#39;m doing: if I&#39;m curious about to learn, creative enough to do something and chaotic enough to have fun, I&#39;ll be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it. At the end of the day, I just need to be more like myself as a child. &lt;strong&gt;There&#39;s no stupid ideas, there&#39;s no stakes.&lt;/strong&gt; I always had fun in the internet, and I&#39;ll do again, but as a person that lived more, learned more and knows how to do more. And if you liked it, I would love to connect with you, through my articles, reviews, projects or stupid tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just read something and want to comment, talk! Are you a content creator that wants to chat and maybe do something together? Get in touch! Are you a gaming developer/publisher/PR agency and thinks that I would do a good review of your game? Send me an email!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No pressure, just vibes.&lt;/strong&gt; It feels like a new part of me is alive again, and I&#39;m just so excited to have fun with this strange place again. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/review/kirby-forgotten-land.html"/>
    <updated>2023-12-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/review/kirby-forgotten-land.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a little contradictory love to Kirby. I love him. Kirby is the perfect video game character ever made. Kirby is round, Kirby is pink, Kirby sleeps and eats, Kirby defeats demons and gods with one poyo. It&#39;s like a cat, but without fur and with the actual power of copying the ability of everything it touches. &lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s impossible to not want to be friends with Kirby.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, at the same time, I never really liked to play a Kirby game. Besides some spin-offs, every time I tried one, I mostly gave up before finishing. I don&#39;t have a problem with easy platformers, but Kirby games always felt &amp;quot;too much of the same&amp;quot;. Even in Planet Robobot, probably the best 2D Kirby game, I can&#39;t remember much of it without mixing it in my head. It&#39;s easy to see why people love them, but it wasn&#39;t for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I say that &lt;strong&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Land is one of my favorite games of all time&lt;/strong&gt;, I want you to understand how much powerful is this sentence. It&#39;s SO DIFFERENT of everything that came before, and, at the same time, so familiar to what to expect with a Kirby game. &lt;strong&gt;The whole idea of a Kirby game changed perspective&lt;/strong&gt; to me when I started playing Forgotten Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...yes, it was a joke, it&#39;s the first 3D game of the franchise, like, ever. Actually, the whole 3D thing isn&#39;t that impactful for me. It was perfect, and they managed to translate the gameplay perfectly. &lt;strong&gt;But when you do the first 3D game of a franchise, and this isn&#39;t even the most impactful thing of the whole title, you know you created a masterpiece.&lt;/strong&gt; And HAL did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Strange horizon. Ready to go.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a concept in film making that is really important for true classics that want to be memorable: &lt;strong&gt;set pieces&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea here is to invest a lot of money, production and time to create a scene so impactful, so incredible, that will be remembered even years after you watched it. If you want to summarize a movie with good set pieces, you will probably only cite them in order and everyone will remember what film you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land/mall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kirby entering a mall and facing enemies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept can also be applied on video games, of course, and there&#39;s a lot of gaming classics that do this really well. For me, until now, Kirby games didn&#39;t have that much of memorable set pieces. If they had, it was like the lore dumping next to the end of the game — that probably was so absurd (with a big god-like creature and a tragic backstory) that becomes memorable by comparison. I would finish a Kirby game and all the memories became a mush in my head, always that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgotten Land is the opposite.&lt;/strong&gt; You can show me the name and title of any level on the entire game and I will remember something from it. In different levels of impact, every single stage in this game has a different thing to be experienced. Sometimes, it just a little gimmick, like a big enemy you can defeat. Other times, it&#39;s an amazing and beautiful set piece featuring a roller coaster (no more spoilers than this), so cool that me and my wife repeated it SIX TIMES, back to back, just to play it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land/wondaria.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kirby on a space-themed amusement park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a new setting helps a lot in creating these moments. As much as I love Dream Land&#39;s cuteness, I can&#39;t see a Green Greens lookalike and be excited, you know? But &lt;strong&gt;this &amp;quot;new world&amp;quot;, this literal Forgotten Land, is so different and familiar at the same time.&lt;/strong&gt; This idea of a post-apocalyptic place, abandoned by human-like and consumed again by sentient nature... And they double down on it, showing different town styles, creating levels around human-made structures, and probably way more shopping malls they needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And everything just followed along with the scenario to be even more memorable. Although the mini-bosses are still just &amp;quot;big enemies&amp;quot;, &lt;strong&gt;The Beast Pack — the big bad guys here — are enormous, feral, literally wild.&lt;/strong&gt; The soundtrack too is so good in this idea of mixing familiarity and curiosity. I know that my favorite song is the vocal main theme, but you have listened the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0X0LIRlt_4&quot;&gt;King Dedede theme&#39;s remix for Forgotten Land&lt;/a&gt;? I can kill a beast with my bare hands just hearing this BANGER. &lt;s&gt;(no, I can&#39;t)&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land/town.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Waddle Dee Town&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finishing touch for the &amp;quot;new world&amp;quot; for me is &lt;strong&gt;Waddle Dee Town&lt;/strong&gt;. I always loved the Waddle Dees and having them build a whole village as you rescue them is so cute! — and a great way to integrate all the extra content besides the main story. I really like this concept of evolving your status during a game (we&#39;ll talk more about in a second), it&#39;s so rewarding this process that becomes half of the fun for me. Going back from a stage and reading &amp;quot;There&#39;s new things in Waddle Dee Town for you!&amp;quot; always gave me a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;No one can hold you back. New fields full of mystery.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s really nice to have an amazing scenario, but this is still a game! Those cool set pieces I talked about before are always interactive. Some of them is just good level design, but a lot of them have a great mechanic behind it: &lt;strong&gt;if the thing is too big, Kirby doesn&#39;t copy its ability, but instead became part of it in the Mouthful Mode!&lt;/strong&gt; For gamers, it&#39;s like Cappy&#39;s capture power in Super Mario Odyssey. For 2000s cartoon kids, it&#39;s like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ben10.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrade_(Classic)&quot;&gt;the alien Upgrade from Ben 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you find a cone, Kirby can swallow it and use its pointed side to attack enemies or breaking walls when ground pounding. Or if Kirby swallows a vending machine, he becomes a soda machine gun. OR IF KIRBY SWALLOWS A CAR, KIRBY CAR IS BORN. Car-Mouth Kirby is one of the cutest images ever imagined by humanity since the first person opened their eyes. My son will be called Carby because of him. &lt;strong&gt;I will protect Kirby Car forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land/car.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Car-Mouth Kirby&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those small moments of gameplay change are really cool. Not only to allow more amazing set pieces, but to break the monotony of &amp;quot;barefoot Kirby&amp;quot; that can happen sometimes. There isn&#39;t a lot of Mouthful Modes available, and a lot of them are recycled during the adventure, but it&#39;s a really fun feature anyways. I can be Kirby and a car at the same time! It&#39;s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I cited &amp;quot;barefoot Kirby&amp;quot;, I think this is &lt;strong&gt;the game that made Copy Abilities really fun to me finally&lt;/strong&gt;. In concept, the power of getting the ability of the enemies is amazing: you can get different powers every level, find your favorites and sticking to them (until a collectable forces you to use a specific Copy Ability). In practice, you see everything that is available in the first world of the game and keep using them until you finished it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;472&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_B-qk4_V2jY&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Forgotten Land, the Copy Abilities can be upgraded&lt;/strong&gt; and I&#39;ve never been so happy in a Kirby game before. To start, the blueprints you need to unlock them sometimes are well hidden in the levels, doubling down as a cool collectable to search for. Then, you need Rare Stones from challenge stages as currency — I never cared for them before, but with the gameplay variety here, they just became little and interesting puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you upgrade a ability, they doesn&#39;t lose their essence, but they got new visuals and extra abilities from there. The Fire ability makes Kirby breathe fire, but Volcano Fire Kirby can shoot flaming magma stones way much further. The new Ranger ability gives Kirby a Gun™, but Noble Ranger Kirby can just use those pistols as machine guns if he charges. The control scheme is the same, but &lt;strong&gt;the sense of power and discovery changes completely with each new evolution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/kirby-forgotten-land/upgrade.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Noble Ranger Kirby, Fleur Tornado Kirby and Toy Hammer Kirby&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to spoil more of the game, but some of them are even inspired by enemies and bosses — getting them somehow seems even more rewarding. Games like RPGs have this concept of showing player&#39;s evolution in power, mostly connected to a lot of stats and formulas. But Forgotten Land just found an easy and visual way to make Kirby even powerful, allowing the player to experience it changing the most basic element in the franchise. The new clothes that Kirby get is 60% of the coolness, it&#39;s important to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Feast your eyes on a new world!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started playing &lt;strong&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&lt;/strong&gt; waiting for Kirby in 3D. Nothing more than that. A good time controlling the best character ever made. &lt;strong&gt;But I got so much more.&lt;/strong&gt; An amazing world, with incredible set pieces and memorable characters. A soundtrack worth of listening in loop for days. An hilarious mechanic to allow new possibilities. An evolution system that no one really asked for, but changed the game for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had so much fun that I literally played the game twice, at the same time. First as the Waddle Dee protector of my wife, than again as Kirby in another save file. I&#39;ve done all the Treasure Roads, even finished the Colosseum mode. For a franchise that I didn&#39;t care much about, I&#39;m as surprised as you on how happy I am now. &lt;strong&gt;If this is the new baseline for Kirby games, just give me more of my puffball and I&#39;ll love video games forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doctor Who: 60th Anniversary Specials</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/review/doctor-who-60th-specials.html"/>
    <updated>2023-12-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/review/doctor-who-60th-specials.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How many people can say casually that their favorite TV series is going to its &lt;strong&gt;60th anniversary&lt;/strong&gt; and still strong as ever? I&#39;m one of them, because &lt;strong&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most special shows in the world&#39;s (and my) history. Since the first TARDIS materialization in November 23th 1963, our favorite Time Lord visited galaxies, met personalities and saved the day way more times than everyone can count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking personally, &lt;strong&gt;I didn&#39;t really know what to expect for those 60th Anniversary Specials&lt;/strong&gt;. The only &amp;quot;modern celebration&amp;quot; we had was 10 years ago, in the marvelous, intricate and already-a-classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hRy2N2CMhQ&quot;&gt;The Day of the Doctor&lt;/a&gt;. This special was not only incredible as a multi-Doctor episode and a major retcon for the &amp;quot;revival series&amp;quot;, but paid homage to so many characters, stories and themes of the past of the show. It was a concept that made sense at the time too, with a well established production team and a veteran face already in the role of The Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now looking at retrospect, &lt;strong&gt;2023 had a totally different context&lt;/strong&gt;. A production era was coming to an end, with Chris Chibnall stepping down from the role of showrunner and the final scenes of Jodie Whittaker as 13th Doctor being shown. Russell T Davies was back with a lot of morale and trust from the BBC and the fans, a huge distribution deal with Disney guaranteed worldwide distribution of the new episodes and even a new face for the Doctor was already there with Ncuti Gatwa. There was no promises of a new DotD, there was no context to a celebration at the same tone, but I think everyone expected it anyway, including me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;SPOILERS, SWEETIE!&lt;/b&gt;
    This review has spoilers for all 3 specials, and some commentary about the plot of the revival series of Doctor Who (2005-2023).
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review isn&#39;t just about what I liked in those new Doctor Who adventures. But also &lt;strong&gt;how my expectations changed, week by week, when looking for answers&lt;/strong&gt;. Why bring back David Tennant — as the new 14th Doctor and not the 10th? Why bring back Donna Noble, the only companion in the revival series that couldn&#39;t have been brought back? Why bring back one of the oldest and forgotten classic villains? It all starts with a spaceship crashing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;472&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEkC6InjWQ8&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Special 1: The Star Beast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what was THE BIG THING on this first special, but can I start talking about &lt;strong&gt;The Star Beast&lt;/strong&gt; recognizing it as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_and_the_Star_Beast_(comic_story)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Who Magazine comic story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brought to TV? The expanded universe was so important for the history of DW (specially during the 90s hiatus) and having it more present on the main show — in a way that everyone can enjoy — is so cool. With the whole &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvbDYtDZk1s&quot;&gt;Whoniverse&lt;/a&gt; thing going on, it would be nice to have more of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can talk about the real star of the episode: &lt;strong&gt;Donna Noble is back!&lt;/strong&gt; I always loved her interactions with the 10th Doctor and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThRX-WALX9g&quot;&gt;her farewell in Journey&#39;s End&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most emotional scenes in that era. Showing how she continued her life, forming her family and trying to live after donating the Doctor&#39;s money gift was really interesting — I don&#39;t know if being extremely rich would be a good character for Donna anyway. Shaun Temple is a good husband, Sylvia Noble is still terrified of everything sci-fi to protect her daughter and I can&#39;t describe how much I loved Rose Noble, portrayed really well by Yasmin Finney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/noble.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shaun Temple, Rose Noble and Donna Noble&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money problems aside, Donna had everything for a happy family and life, but we Whovians know that there&#39;s a problem to be solved. The whole &amp;quot;we can just let it go&amp;quot; don&#39;t worked for me, and I really didn&#39;t understand yet how the biggest thing of a whole Series was solved in three lines and some VFX. But all that said, the idea of Donna AND Rose sharing the Meta-Crisis and helping each other was marvelous and so beautiful to see. The binary/non-binary reference, Donna&#39;s love for her daughter and how Rose can now be truly herself was perfect and a good ending for a frantic adventure. &lt;s&gt;(a little bit of foreshadowing too, huh)&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, right? &lt;strong&gt;The Star Beast&lt;/strong&gt; is a hell of an adventure! This furry piece of shit Beep the Meep never got me (but got my wife and her reaction was memorable). A really good villain with a different backstory and powers than just &amp;quot;I&#39;m big and bad&amp;quot; — the psychedelic sun hypnosis was a really cool touch. It&#39;s so cool to see how the Meep changes during the Doctor&#39;s improvised trial from a puffball to a unsatiable demon. A great monster that couldn&#39;t be lost in some old comic pages. As I said, the show needs to use more its expanded universe and if Meep isn&#39;t the example for that, I don&#39;t know what could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/meep.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Donna Noble, Beep the Meep and Rose Noble&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for everything that happened in this first special, &lt;strong&gt;the most important&lt;/strong&gt; (for me and for my hopeful conclusion of this review) &lt;strong&gt;is the Fourteenth Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, it&#39;s David Tennant again, and he&#39;s a top-tier actor as everyone knows, but I really love how it&#39;s a different regeneration of The Doctor. 10th was so much energetic and incisive, jumping from one thing to the other in a blink of an eye. 14th, however, shows how much they grew during the past incarnations: it seems to be a wiser, self-conscious and really traumatized creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, really, I think that every special on this run has &lt;strong&gt;at least&lt;/strong&gt; one scene of 14th bursting in rage, specially in moments that someone would get hurt or die. The Doctor always reacted to those moments, but it really seems that this incarnation is at the brink of exploding every time. The Doctor isn&#39;t well after all he lost (and specially after a part of the universe being destroyed by the Flux). This is the 14th Doctor&#39;s personal journey for me, and I&#39;ll talk about it in a moment. First, however, we need to do a quick stop at the end of the universe...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Special 2: Wild Blue Yonder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not the biggest fan of horror or suspense movies, so you can imagine that those episodes on Doctor Who weren&#39;t in my top lists (yes, I&#39;m talking to all Blink fans right there). &lt;strong&gt;Wild Blue Yonder&lt;/strong&gt; is a weird turn in the middle of those anniversary specials: it&#39;s definitely a great episode that even I could enjoy, but doesn&#39;t really add a lot to the overarching plot of the 14th Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said, it was a really interesting mystery from start to finish: those &amp;quot;not-things&amp;quot; were terrifying, using the appearance of The Doctor and Donna to be deformed and scary. I think that the episode wouldn&#39;t have worked so well with original faces being copied instead of familiar ones. The tension of not having the TARDIS or the sonic screwdriver (after the materialized walls in Special 1) and having to find a way to get out of the situation was one of RTD best stories to date on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/yonder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Not-Things imitating the bodies of Donna Noble and the 14th Doctor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once more, 14th&#39;s overflowing emotions break through again, not only in his now-traditional rage scene, but in the dialog with &amp;quot;not-Donna&amp;quot;. As a person that liked the Timeless Child concept from the beginning, it&#39;s cool to see that the revelation of past lives is still in The Doctor&#39;s mind, as it should be. More than ever and with an unexpected face, The Doctor needs to understand who they are and what&#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is it for me, not a lot more to say. Not my favorite, although one of the best &amp;quot;horror episodes&amp;quot; in the series. A special recognition for Bernard Cribbins&#39; last scene ever, with one last and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nivoWTPXAg4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emotional appearance of Wilfred Mott&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our loved grandpa. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDzqz2TpxHU&quot;&gt;that pun with Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt; was gold, to be fair, I was so proud of those two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;(a digression about The Doctor&#39;s personal journeys)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I continue to Special 3, I need to digress a little to talk about how I always looked at &lt;strong&gt;The Doctor&#39;s personal journeys&lt;/strong&gt; (or identity crises, if you want) in the revival series. I won&#39;t claim that I&#39;m the first to think about that, but it&#39;s important talk about it to understand why I loved 14th Doctor&#39;s regeneration on the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of era, showrunner or vibe of each series, I always loved how The Doctor was, since the fateful Last Great Time War, in a constant search for answers of who they really are. More specifically, the two keywords for me were &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;power&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;loss&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. In each new series, with each new Doctor, we have seen them realizing how much impact their actions had in the timeline — and how this power was not enough to compensate all the people they lost through the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Eccleston&#39;s 9th Doctor was the first to face this question, being the one immediately after the war and The Moment. One day, he just was one Time Lord, one creature of a big civilization, known for its influence and power throughout the universe. But now, he is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXdRts6kJC0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Last of the Time Lords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, he was forced-regenerated, exiled and summoned by the High Council — now it&#39;s just him. It was only one season (so this was elaborated later), but &lt;strong&gt;9th was the Doctor that understood that there was no one to stop him anymore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/9-10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9th Doctor, Rose Tyler and 10th Doctor in front of the TARDIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Tennant&#39;s 10th Doctor continued that to extreme levels. There wasn&#39;t a Doctor in the revival series that needed the companions to stop him more than 10. There wasn&#39;t an enemy that he can&#39;t defeat with menacing eyes and so much fury, he was THE ONE that destroyed Gallifrey to stop a war. There was only him, powerful than ever, so powerful that he thinks the Laws of Time were his, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gchry9XuolA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Lord Victorious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He is also the Doctor that realized how much he lost friends, civilizations and worlds during all his lives. &lt;strong&gt;10th was the Doctor that learned how to be powerful, but couldn&#39;t stop the losses with his power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debut episode of Matt Smith&#39;s 11th Doctor shows exactly who he is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arAjbSkKF-Q&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, I&#39;m the Doctor. Basically, run.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is such a powerful line. He knows he&#39;s powerful and now feared through the galaxy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa74e8oAvIM&quot;&gt;The Pandorica Speech&lt;/a&gt;, having every one of their enemies just fleeing in fear... The Doctor isn&#39;t just &amp;quot;a Time Lord&amp;quot; anymore, he is &lt;strong&gt;The Oncoming Storm&lt;/strong&gt;, a good man going to war. It&#39;s even more easy to see when 11th is the most goofy Doctor in the revival series by the pure contrast of those two personas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11th Doctor surrounded by spaceships&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he was the first to understand he was too powerful. His biggest enemy wasn&#39;t Daleks or Cybermen, it was the Silence, creatures whose only goal in life was to silence the Doctor. He had to fake his own death because he&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;got too big, too noisy&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. The Doctor was always sad to lose a companion, but this Doctor tried to retire after losing Amy and Rory. The power was too much, the loss was too. &lt;strong&gt;11th was the Doctor that realized something needed to change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that Peter Capaldi&#39;s 12th Doctor had the &lt;strong&gt;most explicit personal journey&lt;/strong&gt; in the revival series. The questioning feelings of his previous incarnation shaped who he is. He constantly questions himself of who he really is, if he is even a good man. Even his face was chosen to remember him about that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjJ_VAubRs&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I am an idiot, with a box and a screwdriver, passing through, helping out, learning.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I love how his last words are the essence of what the character is: &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJqsPBWbtjk&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;laugh hard, run fast, be kind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. The Doctor understood himself again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12th Doctor and 1st Doctor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I said there were TWO keywords for this journey and we haven&#39;t talked about how 12th reacted to the loss (and isn&#39;t very well). That &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJP9o4BEziI&quot;&gt;speech on &lt;em&gt;The Zygon Inversion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows exactly how much traumatizing the Time War still is for The Doctor. When he loses Clara for the raven, he goes to the extreme of rescuing her on her last breath because he can&#39;t face losing one more friend. For God&#39;s sake, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suUv4slpr3I&quot;&gt;Heaven Sent&lt;/a&gt; isn&#39;t just a cinematic masterpiece, but the most intimate episode of Doctor Who ever made. &lt;strong&gt;12th was the Doctor that found their essence again, but accumulate so much trauma and memories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jodie Whittaker&#39;s 13th Doctor was born in those Capaldi&#39;s last words. She was always running, laughing with her fam and being the kindest Doctor in decades. &lt;strong&gt;Her personal journey, to me, was more of a test.&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine finally finding your essence again and then discovering that you had ANOTHER LIVES, way before you imagined. When 13th looks to all the emotional charge of the Timeless Child and her Division&#39;s past lives and just buried it inside the TARDIS... she just confirmed who she is. She is The Doctor, the creature they always wanted to be, and it will continue to try. As they said once, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3Xx4NbPkHGM&amp;amp;t=160&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The name you choose is like a promise you make&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and she doubled down on it. &lt;strong&gt;13th was the Doctor that confirmed her essence and chose again to be in her promise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13th Doctor and Fugitive Doctor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when she&#39;s got to regenerate, although... She not only lost so many friends and had to, one point, live with the guilt of destroying her own planet. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJmbrVCtMWs&quot;&gt;the Flux also destroyed a huge part of the universe&lt;/a&gt; she promised to protect — and even she doesn&#39;t recognize or remember, her time at Division was the starting point of it. She knew who The Doctor is, but doesn&#39;t knew how to cope with all of the trauma. &lt;strong&gt;14th starts his life with the wisdom and sadness that only someone that lost so much has.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Special 3: The Giggle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it&#39;s the end of the recap and we&#39;re back to the present to talk about &lt;strong&gt;The Giggle&lt;/strong&gt;, the last 60th anniversary special. And oh boy, &lt;strong&gt;this was THE EPISODE&lt;/strong&gt;. Before entering in the subject of those personal journeys again, I just love it how adventurous and mysterious was the whole thing, even if we already know that the Toymaker was the bad guy behind all. I always love when a real historical thing becomes a plot point, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stooky_Bill&quot;&gt;Stooky Bill&lt;/a&gt; — the real-world first object televised in history — would make everyone crazy even without the magic giggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Patrick Harris as the Toymaker&lt;/strong&gt; was completely amazing. I&#39;m always insecure when a big actor comes to do a big part in Doctor Who, but NPH nailed so well that I&#39;m really sad the Toymaker was banished from existence forever. His character is so strange sometimes: it&#39;s like the Toymaker is a &amp;quot;chaotic lawful&amp;quot; god, always following the rules of the game, even if this counts against him. From the marionette recap to the Spice Girls incredible entrance, NPH make an already good episode to an unforgettable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/toymaker.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Neil Patrick Harris as the Toymaker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a lot of other characters really well presented too, what is a contrast of oh-my-God-this-is-one-more-thing-in-this-convoluted-story style of Chibnall during the 13th era. Kate Stewart is always badass (with an amazing, vulnerable performance by Jemma Redgrave), Melanie Bush is back and I already wanted more of companions in UNIT&#39;s paycheck and I&#39;m really curious by the new scientific advisor Shirley Anne Bingham and what more she can bring to the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, The Giggle would be a great episode already, but we get it. A myth becoming reality by the Toymaker, we have the first (and probably only one) &lt;strong&gt;bi-generation in the history of Doctor Who&lt;/strong&gt;! Instead of just a new face, The Doctor divided in two, granting us the first peek (and what a peek!) at Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s 15th Doctor. He&#39;s frantic, he&#39;s ready to take on the universe and he&#39;s strangely confident. Facing the Toymaker or talking with his past self, he seems to know more than we generally expect from a post-regeneration Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/bigeneration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14th Doctor and 15th Doctor during the bi-generation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most beautiful part of this special, and the true story arc for the specials, is &lt;strong&gt;14th Doctor&#39;s personal journey&lt;/strong&gt;. As I said before, 13th was tested and confirmed her identity and values as The Doctor, but all the memories they had... was too much. It was so consistent in those specials: 14th was always in an emotional burnout, about to explode. Every provocation about his past, seeing the worst part of humanity wide open by the Toymaker. The Doctor couldn&#39;t do anymore. He needed help, and he chose the face who get most traumas to seek that help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so precious seeing how the two Doctors interacted. 15th wasn&#39;t just kind to his past self, he was the only that understood. The only one who could know all the pain and loss he suffered, and how the sole thing that he could do was move forward, never looking back. For the first time in years, the 15th Doctor was not afraid of looking to the past. He was there to shelter themselves, to give a hug, to accept a creature that did so much and lost even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/hug.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14th Doctor and 15th Doctor hugging&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I&#39;m fine because you fix yourself. We&#39;re Time Lords. We&#39;re doing rehab out of order.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; This was the key dialogue for me. The trust in the 15th&#39;s voice when saying that showed to me the true meaning of the bi-generation. Yes, they could bring Tennant back if they can (and, to be fair, nothing ever stopped BBC to do that, all the Doctors are traveling in space-time anyway). But the bi-generation allows us to see The Doctor heal. Look into their past, understand what happened to all of his lives, the ones that they loved (and the ones that they lost). And, of course, without having a timejump or a hiatus, it&#39;s a time travel show! The 15th Doctor is not &amp;quot;a clone&amp;quot;, he is The Doctor, but healed. &lt;strong&gt;14th was the Doctor that finally stopped to face his past and his loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And seeing him, with his new family, just laughing and looking forward to retire, it&#39;s so meaningful and amazing. &lt;strong&gt;For all The Doctor did for the universe, he deserved some peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A new Doctor for a new future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we didn&#39;t get a new &amp;quot;Day of the Doctor&amp;quot; after all. And a lot of people would say the specials were not &amp;quot;commemorative enough&amp;quot; — and they are also right. I would love to have seen a more cameo-filled episode instead of Wild Blue Yonder, for example. But, having watched all three, I think I can understand what was the goal of all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Day of the Doctor was all about celebrating the past. 50 years of a TV show that is still running, in the same continuity, is amazing and worth celebrating, of course. &lt;strong&gt;Those 60th anniversary specials were, instead, about preparing the future.&lt;/strong&gt; Using figments of the past, stories that needed a conclusion, to help The Doctor do one thing that he never would do normally. 14th is fixing, so 15th can already be on Christmas, being The Doctor we know and love, and we will know even more and love even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time we got a reboot, its motor was a big war, with a lot of death, destruction and trauma. But today, the new generation of Doctor Who, the one that will travel through space and time for next 20 years, is different. &lt;strong&gt;The new Whoniverse starts with healing, kindness and maturity&lt;/strong&gt; — and I&#39;m waiting to grow, change and learn with it again, as I did in my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/doctor-who-60th-specials/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15th Doctor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Born of Bread</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/review/born-of-bread.html"/>
    <updated>2023-12-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/review/born-of-bread.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I talk about something I love, I always fear to be way more verbose than I needed to be, you know? I love this thing, and I need to talk about every detail, every little thing that makes this special. A good example will be talking about &lt;strong&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/strong&gt;, a RPG released for the Nintendo 64 you may have heard about. It was my first RPG, the acronym that my parents always said that was a devil&#39;s work in children&#39;s lives. (I love my parents by the way, and I know they were only trying to protect me with the information they had at the time, so I&#39;m not mad...) but the cute and heroic Super Mario was OK for then, so Paper Mario became this starting point for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;I LOVE IT&lt;/strong&gt;. I played non-stop for days until finish the game, struggling with walkthroughs because I didn&#39;t really knew English at the time. The action commands were a game changer for me: a turn-based battle system with them was not boring, but fun, and dynamic! And the plot, the characters, everything in this game was so cool! It was because of Paper Mario that I discovered RPG Maker, and then online communities, and then coding, and then computer science... OK, I just got verbose again. &lt;strong&gt;I love Paper Mario, and I know Paper Mario a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, and that&#39;s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, just as it&#39;s hard to talk about a thing that I love, it&#39;s also hard to talk about a new thing that was inspired by something that I loved. For some months of my childhood, my small boy version was obsessed with Paper Mario, and now, even this is the review of &lt;strong&gt;Born of Bread&lt;/strong&gt;, a NEW game made in 2023, I&#39;ll compare both, down to the smallest details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This time, however, is not my fault.&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Understanding the recipe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s nothing wrong with creating a new game using a structure that even Nintendo abandoned for years. You may have heard of the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Paperverse&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, a cute name for a Paper Mario-like RPG. The most common features that are borrowed from the original game are, mostly, &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; a blend of 3D scenarios with 2D character sprites (as they were walking paper sheets); &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; a focus on simple exploration of the maps, using the character&#39;s abilities to overcome obstacles; and &lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt; a turn-based battle system using &amp;quot;action commands&amp;quot;, small QTEs that can be use to power attack and defense. You can easily see this recipe on &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1082710/Bug_Fables_O_Broto_da_Eternidade/&quot;&gt;2019&#39;s Bug Fables&lt;/a&gt; and future&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996390/Escape_from_Ever_After/&quot;&gt;Escape from Ever After&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Born of Bread&lt;/strong&gt;, created by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wildartsgames.com/&quot;&gt;WildArts&lt;/a&gt; team and published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dearvillagers.com/&quot;&gt;Dear Villagers&lt;/a&gt;, is a Paperverse game, of course. The star, instead of the red plumber, is Loaf, a bread golem that gains life during a riot at his kingdom by creatures from the past. His job is to find friends and save the world recovering pieces of a special gem, that was broken into pieces and long forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;472&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qbF1Jmvxdw8&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that I listed before is in the game. The visuals are exceptionally gorgeous, with some detailed animations and really cool scenarios — I don&#39;t think if this justify the &amp;quot;next-gen&amp;quot; compatibility on Xbox and PlayStation although. The maps are small, but you are invited to explore them using Loaf (or their friends) abilities. And even the action commands are there, to press buttons at the certain times and do more damage. The recipe is there, and it&#39;s cooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the devil are on the details, and as I said, I&#39;ll talk about details. There&#39;s a LOT of Paper Mario in Born of Bread, more than the usual Paperverse inspiration. It&#39;s not plagiarism by any means: all the content here is original and you can&#39;t patent game mechanics. But I couldn&#39;t imagine other way this game was made instead of &lt;strong&gt;a big list of &amp;quot;things that Paper Mario does and we need to do too&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loaf&#39;s primary (and world map) attack is the same as Mario&#39;s Hammer. In the battles, you have a resource for health, one for special attacks and a third for even-more-special attacks (like Star Power). Those even-more-special attacks are unlocked in a plot basis, like the Star Spirits&#39; abilities. You can collect boons to get passive abilities (like badges), and more spaces for them can be get in level ups. If you want to include The Thousand-Year Door: the partners also have HP and there&#39;s an &amp;quot;audience&amp;quot; that can recover some points if you succeed in the QTEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/born-of-bread/battle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The start of a battle with an enemy in Born of Bread&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; things about Paper Mario are here! You can only save in specific points of the map (at least, my little dragon Dub — that I&#39;ll protect forever — is better than a rainbow block). Your item inventory has a really small limit, so you&#39;ll constantly will throw useful items away. The map in the menu it&#39;s still useless, and you still need to open a context menu to change partners. I really wanted a hotkey to change partners, for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was playing a new game, with a new plot, interesting characters and a beautiful world, but I was still bothered by the same details that my 10-year-old self was too. They didn&#39;t need to be full on board with this &amp;quot;list&amp;quot;, specially having less resources and a smaller scope. Because the list was not enough: there&#39;s a LOT of original ideas here, and that&#39;s other part of the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Flavors in quantity, not intensity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did wasn&#39;t fair: &lt;strong&gt;Born of Bread is NOT ONLY a rehash of a 2000 game.&lt;/strong&gt; There is so much original ideas and concepts here, mixed together with the intention of creating a mechanic identity for the game. But if you use all the seasoning you have in your kitchen, it&#39;s not guaranteed to create a powerful flavor. If nothing stands out, your food will be a little bland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example is how you can personalize the character&#39;s builds, including attacks. In the original Paper Mario, it was really simple: Mario can get new abilities by badges, and the partners finding special blocks in the overworld. It&#39;s straight to the point, and cannot offer a lot of strategies if we can be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/born-of-bread/backpack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Backpack system in Born of Bread&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born of Bread just goes over the top. Loaf has a &lt;strong&gt;backpack mechanic like a Resident Evil inventory&lt;/strong&gt;, where every equipment is a shape that needs to be put inside a square to be available for battle. Each friend, in the other hand, has a full, exclusive &lt;strong&gt;skill tree&lt;/strong&gt;, that can only be unlocked using Skill Points — THAT YOU NEED TO EXCHANGE to special souls you find in the overworld. Unlocking a full row in the skill tree (whose only one ability can be equipped at a time), that partner gets a HP bonus. And as I said, &lt;strong&gt;boons are also a type of equippable thing&lt;/strong&gt; that can give passives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with having a lot of those systems is that no one is deep enough to allow for cool strategies. It&#39;s like juggle three different mechanics and they just don&#39;t stick. The backpack puzzle is too simple, the skill tree is grindy, the boons are way less interesting than Mario&#39;s badges. A part of me just wanted the backpack, but for every character. Just include more pieces in the puzzle (like adjacent bonuses? or put one-use items in the mix?) and it would be an important, dense and well made flavor for a game so inspired by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/reviews/born-of-bread/command.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Action command being executed in a battle in Born of Bread&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example are the action commands themselves. I was already tired of the same 6-8 QTEs when I was at the middle of the story, because a lot of good abilities just ask you to press a random sequence of buttons in order. The same QTE would appear in every character&#39;s build, sometimes multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, at the same time, Born of Bread tries to be Pokémon and has a &lt;strong&gt;DOUBLE-LAYERED WEAKNESS SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;. There are &amp;quot;attack types&amp;quot; in a rock-paper-scissors fashion, and every enemy has a type and ONLY resistance for one of them, but there also &amp;quot;elemental types&amp;quot; that uses a round robin diagram to allow ONLY weaknesses in enemies to double damage. You can&#39;t see those types during battle, you haven&#39;t a lot of those types until way later in the game. Confused? Me too. I just considered then random for the most part, because it was ONE MORE system to understand in a relatively easy game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s so much original ideas in Born of Bread, and I just cited some of them, but the lack of focus just undermine those cool flavors. If you can feel everything at the same time, and they don&#39;t harmonize together, you just feel &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; — and &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; is not that memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A good package, undercooked&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I would bother to write that amount of text just to say the game is kinda OK? Because I think that &lt;strong&gt;Born of Bread has a really good flavor in the middle of this bad-inspired dough&lt;/strong&gt;. The plot is fun, some characters are cool, the backpack system is clever and play feel is on point (until the QTEs became more repetitive than they needed to). If I wanted to play more Paper Mario, I would play Paper Mario again. It&#39;s even available on NSO to be even easier. I was expecting to play a new thing, inspired by the adventures that I loved with surprises that I would remember afterward. Some of it is here, but not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want a pretty, funny and easy Paperverse RPG? Born of Bread is ready for you to eat and can be served in any digital store of your preference. But the strong flavor that only well-made and focused mechanics can give isn&#39;t in the menu, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best digital games I played in 2022</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2022.html"/>
    <updated>2022-12-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2022.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s already the &lt;strong&gt;third year&lt;/strong&gt; that I&#39;ve spent time in the last week after Christmas reflecting on the games I&#39;ve played. For a type of leisure that I like so much, it&#39;s fun to have a diary of the things I played. It&#39;s really fun to reflect on the choices and experiences I had with my favorite games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is not different, so welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;POTY 2022 - the Played of the Year!&lt;/strong&gt; It was the year that I decided to clear half of my backlog, giving a chance to titles that had been molding there for a while. It was the year I played a lot of new games, given my current status as a &amp;quot;happy Xbox Game Pass subscriber&amp;quot;. It was a year that I gave a chance to some modern online games that have no end. It was a year that I played a lot with my fianceé and created good moments together with the person I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my list of &lt;strong&gt;the best games I played this year&lt;/strong&gt;. It doesn&#39;t matter if the title was launched decades ago: if i&#39;m discovering it for the first time now, it counts. You can see the POTYs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2020&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2021&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt; too, but let&#39;s go for the 2022 list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;20) Rhythm Tengoku / Rhythm Heaven Silver&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Boy Advance, Nintendo, 2006&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rhythm Tengoku&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love rhythm games and few are as unique as Rhythm Heaven. This not-so-famous-and-deserve-more franchise from Nintendo is capable of impress anyone who has the opportunity to play it. Last year, I played the Wii version and now I went after &lt;strong&gt;Rhythm Tengoku&lt;/strong&gt;, the beginning of the series on the GBA, never released in the West. Because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhythmheaven.fandom.com/wiki/Rhythm_Heaven_Silver&quot;&gt;an incredible fan translation&lt;/a&gt;, I could see that the magic was there from the beginning. Even on a portable from 20 years ago, the visual and musical charm of the series is impressive and worth a try for anyone who likes the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;19) Kirby: Planet Robobot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo 3DS, HAL Laboratory/Nintendo, 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kirby: Planet Robobot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a strange coincidence of having two Kirby games at 19th place in consecutive years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-games/Kirby-Planet-Robobot-1091342.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby: Planet Robobot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a pleasant surprise. As much as I love the puff pink ball and his little world, it was always difficult to me to engage on his platform games, either due to the lack of challenge or the repetition of content. Robobot manages to be almost an antithesis of other Kirby games (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-games/Kirby-Triple-Deluxe-855023.html&quot;&gt;Triple Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;, also on the 3DS): really interesting worlds, good level progression and a great idea with the mechas, a very fun gimmick to use every time it appears. If you only want to play ONE main Kirby game, go with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;18) Disney Dreamlight Valley&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/PS4/PS5/XBO/XBS/Switch, Gameloft/Disney, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Disney Dreamlight Valley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the bottom of my heart, I wish I hadn&#39;t liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disney Dreamlight Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so much. As much as Disney films were part of my childhood, today it&#39;s difficult not to have many (MANY) cons with the great mouse machine. Having said all that, &lt;strong&gt;I LOVED DREAMLIGHT VALLEY&lt;/strong&gt;. It&#39;s a game loop similar to Animal Crossing, but less slow and with more things to complete, especially each character&#39;s missions. It&#39;s still in early access, but I&#39;ve 100% finished the content of all the updates released this year... and I&#39;ll probably continue next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;17) Horizon Chase Turbo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Switch/PS4/XBO, Aquiris Game Studio, 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Horizon Chase Turbo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizon Chase is my favorite mobile racing game because of its simplicity and controls. Its &amp;quot;expanded&amp;quot; version for PC and consoles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://horizonchase.com/pt-br/games/horizon-chase-turbo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizon Chase Turbo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, definitely doesn&#39;t lose anything in quality. In fact, it&#39;s quite a sight to see the beautiful low-poly visuals on a big screen. I ended up not being able to try the multiplayer, but the World Tour campaign is still great and a lot of fun. It&#39;s really good to see good Brazilian games getting out there and becaming known for its quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;16) Wii Sports Resort&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii, Nintendo, 2009&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wii Sports Resort&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I went back in time a few years to understand the magic behind the famous &amp;quot;Wii bowling&amp;quot;. And didn&#39;t they manage to make an even better game? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii/Wii-Sports-Resort-283982.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wii Sports Resort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; not only uses Wii MotionPlus very well to improve the experience, but it also brings other much cooler sports. The Wuhu Island and the whole summer vacation vibes are also really cozy and welcome. I spent many hours on the new bowling, table tennis and archery trying to get the best scores and I always come back to play another round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;15) The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux/PS4/PS5/XBO/XBS/Switch, Crows Crows Crows, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stanley Parable&lt;/strong&gt; has become a video game storytelling classic largely because of the innovative way in which it challenges, with each player&#39;s action, the common media narrative and the expectations present in our imagination. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stanleyparable.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will become a video game storytelling classic by challenging the one thing that wasn&#39;t possible in 2013: the video game storytelling classic The Stanley Parable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;14) Tangle Tower&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/PS4/XBO/Switch, SFB Games, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tangle Tower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022 was a year in which I played way more narrative games than usual, mainly about mysteries to be solved. I want to play a lot more next year, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tangletowergame.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tangle Tower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was easily a pleasant surprise. Even though its structure is linear, the game has a very interesting story, great characters, good puzzles and a very unique way of asking questions about the plot. It&#39;s a shame it&#39;s so short, but I was hooked for a few days until I got everything the game had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;13) Beacon Pines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/XBO/XBS/Switch, Hiding Spot Games/Fellow Traveller, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beacon Pines&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a double feature of narrative games, I also didn&#39;t expect to have swallowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://hidingspotgames.com/beaconpines.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beacon Pines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the excitement I did. I never really played a lot of visual novels (specially if the Layton series doesn&#39;t count), but &lt;strong&gt;Beacon Pines&lt;/strong&gt; was a great &amp;quot;first experience&amp;quot; of the genre, with a simple but interesting story, cute and charismatic characters and a smart way to give you pieces of the story while testing new narrative possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;12) Codenames&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web, Czech Games Edition, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Codenames&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love board games, so having a good representation of the digital ones in the POTY this year makes me really happy, specially with a game so great as &lt;a href=&quot;https://codenames.game/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codenames&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s easily one of the smartest party games ever made, with a high dose of interaction between players without getting boring or boring. Playing online doesn&#39;t have exactly the same magic, but it&#39;s a great option, mainly because it&#39;s free and there are cards in Portuguese now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;11) WarioWare: Get It Together!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switch, Intelligent Systems/Nintendo, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WarioWare: Get It Together!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it any surprise to anyone that this crazy microgames thing is by far my favorite Nintendo franchise? Of course. But I also didn&#39;t expect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/warioware-get-it-together-switch/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would be so much fun in multiplayer. The game completely embraces chaos, switching characters all the time, and makes you happy for getting something at the last second (or laughing for not getting it anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know it&#39;s a spoiler, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv-9tXSNBHc&quot;&gt;Penny&#39;s Song was one of the best songs ever made&lt;/a&gt; for a video game in history and anyone who disagrees is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;10) Ynglet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/XBO/XBS, Nifflas Games/Triple Topping, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ynglet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about clearing the backlog this year was finding great games that were lost on my &amp;quot;one day I&#39;ll play&amp;quot; list. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ynglet.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ynglet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was by far the best of them. With a super different &amp;quot;platform game&amp;quot; concept, it&#39;s really enjoyable to simply move through the levels, finding secrets and solving puzzles. Besides being very, very beautiful in its strange world of shapes and molecules. I wish more people played &lt;strong&gt;Ynglet&lt;/strong&gt; and more games tried to be as different as &lt;strong&gt;Ynglet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;09) RPG Time: The Legend of Wright&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/PS4/XBO/XBS/Switch, Aniplex/Deskworks, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RPG Time: The Legend of Wright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no way not to get emotional playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://rpgtime-en.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPG Time: The Legend of Wright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s the story of a child who wants to make games and wants to show you the latest ideas he has. It&#39;s not such a different story from little Gabriel, who cut paper and thought he was programming on the computer, you know? Furthermore, it&#39;s a fun collection of minigames, with a charm and sincerity that few games can have. &lt;strong&gt;RPG Time&lt;/strong&gt; is about a happy child that wants to be a game designer and I couldn&#39;t connect to it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;08) Meow Tower: Nonogram&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android/iOS, Studio Boxcat, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Meow Tower: Nonogram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, who knew, I spent a lot of time playing Picross for another year! &lt;a href=&quot;https://boxcat.notion.site/Meow-Tower-Nonogram-c1d643544063468d8a037c3f7d9d8d14&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meow Tower: Nonogram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great choice if you already love nonograms, or if you&#39;ve never played it before. There are many many puzzles, it&#39;s available for free on mobile devices, without abusive microtransactions AND &lt;strong&gt;THERE ARE CUTE KITTENS&lt;/strong&gt;. LOTS OF KITTENS. YOU TALK TO THE KITTENS, CLEAN THE KITTENS&#39; HOUSES, THEY PUR AND THE KITTENS ARE HAPPY, &lt;strong&gt;PLAY MEOW TOWER NOW.&lt;/strong&gt; For the kitties &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;07) Escape Academy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/PS4/PS5/XBO/XBS, Coin Crew Games/iam8bit, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Escape Academy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://escapeacademygame.com/en&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escape Academy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is perfect, because it isn&#39;t. The visuals aren&#39;t incredible, the characters are a bit monotonous and the game&#39;s story itself is a bit mixed. But, even with all that, it&#39;s probably &lt;strong&gt;the best digital escape room experience ever made&lt;/strong&gt;, and I say that as someone who loves and has even created escape rooms in real life. The rooms are incredible, the puzzles are very clever and even the hint system works well. If are your first (or last) escape room experience, this academy will be a great class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;06) PowerWash Simulator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/PS4/PS5/XBO/XBS/Switch, FuturLab/Square Enix, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PowerWash Simulator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not a game for everyone, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://powerwash-simulator.square-enix-games.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PowerWash Simulator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was definitely made for me. The proposal is simple: use a high-pressure water machine to clean increasingly crazy scenes and objects while actually following a story (yes, a story) that tries to make sense. In the end, it was just relaxing and rewarding to take a filthy place and make it shine again. Just remove the obnoxious water sound, put on a podcast and you&#39;ll be ready to relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;05) Psychonauts 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux/PS4/XBO/XBS, Double Fine Productions/Xbox Game Studios, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Psychonauts 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t played the first chapter of this story yet, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doublefine.com/games/psychonauts-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is almost a masterpiece in narrative, gameplay and world creation. Moving Raz is fun, exploring the increasingly wacky psychic worlds is fun, understanding the story behind the Psychonauts is fun. The only thing that didn&#39;t worked for me was the half-assed combat, but it was easily overcome by the accessibility options. You can clearly see that they did everything they wanted because they weren&#39;t expecting a third game, but I wanted Psychonauts 3 so badly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;04) SteamWorld Dig 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux/PS4/PSVita/3DS/Switch, Image &amp;amp; Form, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SteamWorld Dig 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember playing the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://thunderfulgames.com/games/steamworld-dig/&quot;&gt;SteamWorld Dig&lt;/a&gt; on the 3DS when I bought the game as a self-birthday gift. I didn&#39;t expect to like it so much, but it totally became my jam: exploring, completing, improving and continuing this cycle in a beautiful world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thunderfulgames.com/games/steamworld-dig-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SteamWorld Dig 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; managed to be better in ALL aspects. The movement is better, the gameplay loop is better, the story is better, the progression is better, even the visuals are more gorgeous (even on the small 3DS screen). If this is your type of game, &lt;strong&gt;you need to play SteamWorld Dig 2 NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;03) A Little to the Left&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Android/iOS/Switch, Max Inferno/Secret Mode, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Little to the Left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to believe in &amp;quot;love at first sight&amp;quot; when I saw the first trailer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maxinferno.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Little to the Left&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by each person&#39;s quirks, the idea is to organize common everyday objects in the most pleasurable way possible. The puzzles are smart, new mechanics appear all the time and there&#39;s even a kitten causing confusion. I found the game so fun and enjoyable to play that all the anticipation waiting for it all year was worth it. It almost got the Top 1 on this POTY, but you have to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;02) Tinykin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/PS4/PS5/XBO/XBS/Switch, Splashteam/tinyBuild, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tinykin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring beautifully crafted worlds — and building a game around it — is what makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinykingame.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinykin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; such an incredible and special game. Whenever I talk about this game, I use the concept of &amp;quot;dense worlds&amp;quot; because that&#39;s what Tinykin does: every room in the gigantic house you find is full of secrets, mechanics and missions to make the most of it. The movement is incredible, everything is very charismatic and it&#39;s a great injustice not to see this game on all the &amp;quot;Best of 2022&amp;quot; lists out there because it definitely deserves a place there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;01) Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/iOS/PS4/XBO/Switch, Simogo/Annapurna Interactive, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2022/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sayonara Wild Hearts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a gift from a good friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simogo.com/work/sayonara-wild-hearts/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the first game I played in 2022 and it has NEVER left 1st place since then. I cried at the end, so incredible was the experience I had in this catharsis of pop music and neon lights. I can&#39;t explain very well why I liked the game so much, but it manages to use the interactivity of the media to tell a great story, with great visuals and an impeccable soundtrack. &lt;strong&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts got the gold position on my Played of the Year 2022!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&#39;t I start playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pokemongolive.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon GO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; again? It feels like a completely different game than it did in 2016, with many more options, features, and weekly events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half of the list were already &lt;strong&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/strong&gt; games, but it&#39;s still worth mentioning other really cool titles that I played there, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zachtronics.com/last-call-bbs/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Call BBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugsnax.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugsnax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xbox.com/pt-BR/games/store/costume-quest/br74rlmh966k&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costume Quest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thunderfulgames.com/games/the-gunk/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gunk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new rhythm games also came my way this year, like the Rhythm Heaven-like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.halfasleep.games/melatonin/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melatonin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Apple Arcade exclusive &lt;a href=&quot;https://poptapbeat.taiko-ch.net/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the meme you&#39;ve probably seen that is actually a cool game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trombonechamp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trombone Champ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a week off between jobs this year, I practically marathoned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U-games/Bayonetta-2-765382.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayonetta 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Wii U and it was a much cooler experience than I expected. I should try to play the first game in the franchise next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In honor of the series&#39; 60th anniversary in 2023, I began my journey of playing everything &lt;strong&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/strong&gt; I could. While this led me to some interesting things, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maze-theory.com/our-games/doctor-who-the-lonely-assassins&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lonely Assassins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it also led me to the &lt;strong&gt;two worst games I&#39;ve played&lt;/strong&gt; this year: Evacuation Earth and Top Trumps Doctor Who, both on Nintendo DS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was my &lt;strong&gt;3rd Played of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backloggd.com/u/gabtoschi/list/2022-played-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;You can see a more complete list on my Backloggd&lt;/a&gt;, if you want. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and see you on POTY again next year!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best digital games I played in 2021</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2021.html"/>
    <updated>2021-12-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2021.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a world where time has no meaning, I even &lt;strong&gt;played a lot of video games&lt;/strong&gt;! 2021 was a year full of surprises for me: if &lt;a href=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2020&quot;&gt;last year&#39;s list&lt;/a&gt; had several old games because I officially dusted off my Nintendo 3DS... &lt;strong&gt;this was the year for me to buy a Wii U!&lt;/strong&gt; And that&#39;s how I spent the whole year playing things from the last decade (with a few indie games from recent years), but I had fun anyway. At the end of the day, what matters is spending a good amount of time playing games (to try to get away a little bit from the crazy reality that surrounds us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the year ended and with more hope to a better future, we also have my most anticipated award: welcome to &lt;strong&gt;POTY 2021, the Played of the Year!&lt;/strong&gt; This is my end-of-the-year list of &lt;strong&gt;the best games I played this year&lt;/strong&gt;. It doesn&#39;t matter if the title was launched decades ago: if i&#39;m discovering it for the first time now, it counts. You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2020&quot;&gt;2020 edition&lt;/a&gt; too, but let&#39;s go for the 2021 list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;20) Sally’s Law&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/iOS/Android, Nanali Studios, 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sally&#39;s Law&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I decided to test &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google/play-pass/&quot;&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt;, a subscription service for apps and games on Android. There wasn&#39;t much titles that caught my attention (and I hadn&#39;t already played it) at the time, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nanali.net/home/info/1936&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sally&#39;s Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a pleasant surprise. A very short but very clever puzzle-platformer: you play the same level twice, with both runs complementing each other. Add a cute story, a simple and cute look and some collectibles and it&#39;s ready to start our POTY list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;19) Kirby Air Ride&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameCube, HAL Laboratory/Nintendo, 2003&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little effort, you can run GameCube games on the Wii U and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-GameCube/Kirby-Air-Ride-268214.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby Air Ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first of several GCN titles that will appear on this list. In a never-repeated attempt at a pink mascot racing game, Kirby manages to have a totally unique racing game, with very simple controls and very different from what came before it (and even after!). While the main mode features races full of Copy Abilities and dashes, what really won me over (and this is a unpopular opinion, I know) was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWorXJMe5yA&quot;&gt;Top Ride, a racing mode on a single screen&lt;/a&gt;, looking like a slot machine with a little power. It&#39;s time for a sequel to this game for Switch now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;18) Florence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/iOS/Android/Switch, Mountains/Annapurna Interactive, 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Florence&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mix of a comic book, a visual novel and a puzzle game, &lt;a href=&quot;https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/florence&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ended up being a pleasant surprise in the last week of the year. Telling the life story of a young girl, the title uses simple puzzles to reinforce her feelings and those around her in a very beautiful, elegant and smart way. In fact, speaking of beauty, the game is GORGEOUS, made with great attention to detail. It reminded me a lot of the storytelling style of &lt;a href=&quot;https://edithfinch.com/&quot;&gt;What Remains of Edith Finch&lt;/a&gt;, another great recommendation from the same publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;17) Untitled Goose Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Switch/PS4/Xbox One, House House/Panic, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Untitled Goose Game&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I discovered that very few things are as fun as being a totally chaotic goose with the person you love. The hours I played &lt;a href=&quot;https://goose.game/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untitled Goose Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with my girlfriend were, by far, one of the moments I laughed the most this year. From the absurd missions to the 30-minute moments where we just growled at random people to make their lives hell, this game is amazing. UGG itself is really fun, but here&#39;s my very important recommendation to play it with someone else for a even more wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;16) Nintendo Land&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii U, Nintendo, 2012&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nintendo Land&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of the Wii U&#39;s life (which didn&#39;t last long, unfortunately), I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U-games/Nintendo-Land-524069.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Land&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it looked like the coolest game in the world. It wasn&#39;t the coolest, but it&#39;s definitely a lot of fun. With a focus on asymmetric gameplay and the smart use of the (previously new) GamePad tablet-like controller, the game manages to entertain while paying homage to classic franchises… almost always. While some attractions are incredible (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDly7y-EyhE&quot;&gt;Donkey Kong&#39;s Crash Course&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnYCn955Oms&quot;&gt;Takamaru&#39;s Ninja Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bstd3n2ZL1c&quot;&gt;Metroid Blast&lt;/a&gt;), others leave a lot to be desired. It&#39;s not the best console introduction Nintendo has ever made, but it&#39;s a very competent one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;15) WarioWare: Smooth Moves&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii, Intelligent Systems/Nintendo, 2007&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WarioWare: Smooth Moves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no news to anyone that I love this series and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii/WarioWare-Smooth-Moves-283850.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WarioWare: Smooth Moves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is exactly my kind of jam: random microgames, completely different visuals, completely adorable characters and stupid, funny stories. Like a good Wii game, the idea of using motion control for microgames doesn&#39;t always work, but when it does, it&#39;s extremely fun. Bonus points for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7PTQ-vLP_w&quot;&gt;names and introductions of each way to hold the Wii Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which definitely didn&#39;t need to be like that, but had a “sexy-dumb energy” that definitely surprised me. May next year&#39;s list include the new WarioWare on Switch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;14) Tabletop Simulator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux, Berserk Games, 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tabletop Simulator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital platforms made me discover many new titles during the period safe at home and none did it better than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tabletop Simulator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By far it is the best 3D platform for playing boardgames digitally, with a very, very large list of mods made by the community with games and versions that you least imagine. It has its bugs here and there, but if you want to get started with modern board games, there probably isn&#39;t a cheaper and more accessible option right now than TTS. In addition to a friend with lots of board games at home, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;13) The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii U, Nintendo, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first &lt;strong&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/strong&gt; on Wii U wasn&#39;t Breath of the Wild, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-The-Wind-Waker-HD-765386.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wind Waker HD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a remake of one of the GameCube classics, which held me for a few weeks this year. The game is incredibly beautiful and wonderful, even more so in the HD version. Being able to play it lying in bed using just the GamePad made me understand the Switch&#39;s appeal. Many QoL changes made in this version (including the new sail on the boat) helped me better enjoy the delightful story of yet another classic in the franchise. I think the weak point is in the battle system and the design of the dungeons, but it&#39;s still a great game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;12) The Pedestrian&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux/Switch/PS4/PS5/Xbox One/Series X-S, Skookum Arts LLC, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Pedestrian&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one that I didn&#39;t expect I would like so much, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skookum-arts.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pedestrian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a very clever game. Its puzzle ideas are really cool and manages to break a lot of what is expected from a puzzle-platform, even if it has some difficulty spikes out of nowhere. Personally, I thought the game was beautiful, but what caught my attention the most was the incredible work done with symbology and iconography, creating a visual-mechanical identity for the puzzles that is very easy to assimilate and build upon. The end of the game is probably the most brilliant part and only lasts about 15 minutes? Yes, it&#39;s a shame, but it was still a really cool way to end a solid little game that I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;11) Mario Kart 8&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii U, Nintendo, 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mario Kart for me was always just the battle mode, the one where you have to hit items on your opponents to pop their balloons. But with the lack of a decent mode like that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U-games/Mario-Kart-8-765384.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mario Kart 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which was fixed in the Switch port), I settled for ordinary racing… and I LOVED IT? The eighth iteration of the franchise is, by far, the most enjoyable to play, both for the way you control the cars and for the possibilities of what to do with all their mechanics, from turbos to anti-gravity. Furthermore, the game is incredibly beautiful and seeing so many classic tracks (and even from other games, in the DLCs) remade in such a beautiful way makes my heart warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;10) Kororinpa: Marble Mania&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii, Hudson Soft, 2007&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kororinpa: Marble Mania&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a Wii launch title, it&#39;s pretty incredible to see how precise and fun &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii/Kororinpa-281650.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kororinpa: Marble Mania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s motion controls are. The idea of the game is very simple: move the Wii Remote to move a track where a marble moves, collecting all the crystals and reaching the exit. But he does it so well, in such a cute way, that I simply had me glued to the game for about 3 days until I completed all the levels. I also ended up trying Super Monkey Ball on Wii, but it didn&#39;t come close to the precision of Kororinpa, which I highly recommend if that&#39;s your type of jam. If not, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkIkCbkFJfU&quot;&gt;watch speedruns of the game&lt;/a&gt;, which are incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;09) Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameCube, Nintendo, 2001&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Luigi’s Mansion&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-games/Luigi-s-Mansion-2-274347.html&quot;&gt;Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt;, on the 3DS, was one of the most fun games I played on the portable, but it&#39;s cool to see how the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-GameCube/Luigi-s-Mansion-268236.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luigi&#39;s Mansion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on the GameCube, can be so different! At first, I was a little bothered by the small amount of collectibles (which there were a lot on the 3DS) and the confusing structure of the mansion. But, over time, you start memorizing the map and start to focus more on finding alternative paths and beating the big ghosts, which is the focus of the game. It&#39;s a product of its time, but it does a lot of different things and does them very well, in addition to having incredible charisma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;08) Unpacking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux/Switch/Xbox One, Witch Beam/Humble Games, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unpacking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only game actually released in 2021 on this list, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unpackinggame.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpacking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a very different but extremely cozy experience. Not only because of the way she tells her story, but because of the simple but very relaxing gameplay ― except when it makes me guess by trial and error whether a cloth is a towel table, a dish towel, a bath towel or some clothing. A small but very fun thing in this game is the possibility of exporting images and GIFs of your tidying process, because seeing how differently people tidy things is a show in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;07) Assemble With Care&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/iOS, Ustwo Games, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assemble With Care&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few games hit my emotions as hard as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ustwogames.co.uk/games/assemble-with-care/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assemble With Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to look amazing and having a very beautiful plot, the idea of a mechanic around fixing things hooked me into the game in a way I didn&#39;t expect. A lot of people talk about how simple the game&#39;s puzzles are (and they really are easy), but I think that&#39;s where some of the magic comes from for me: I felt like someone who really knew what they were doing, fixing people&#39;s things and discovering their stories. For someone who grew up with his father making repairs as if by magic this game was even more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;06) Wii Sports&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii, Nintendo, 2006&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wii Sports&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES, I had never played &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii/Wii-Sports-283971.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; until this year… why did it never look so cool? On a console with Mario, Zelda and Just Dance, why would my 10-year-old self ask to go bowling at someone&#39;s house? But then I played it and understood the magic of this business: there is no game that better reflects the philosophy of the Wii as a console than &lt;strong&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/strong&gt;. It&#39;s simple, it&#39;s intuitive, it&#39;s fun, everyone can play, everyone can win, everyone can look at this and think that video games are for them too. Only my mother&#39;s happiness playing bowling alone made the game reach this position on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;05) Super Mario 3D World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii U, Nintendo, 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year in which I played &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii/Super-Mario-Galaxy-283322.html&quot;&gt;Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s interesting to think that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U-games/SUPER-MARIO-3D-WORLD-765385.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the game that starts the POTY Top 5. I loved the variety of levels and styles, with each one trying something different, sometimes with more personality than several galaxies in the other game. The idea of exploration is also very present in &lt;strong&gt;3D World&lt;/strong&gt;, with the search for green stars and stamps, which make you look in every corner of each level. On top of all this, I played the whole thing in multiplayer with my girlfriend and it was a really fun and funny experience with lots of great moments. &lt;strong&gt;3D World&lt;/strong&gt; is a great game, much better than its portable cousin and a great iteration of Mario in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;04) Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameCube, Skip Ltd./Bandai/Nintendo, 2006&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-GameCube/Chibi-Robo--267829.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chibi-Robo!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a strange game in all its parts: you control a 10-centimeters-tall little robot that needs to be charged every 5 real life minutes, trying to clean the house and help solve the problems of a dysfunctional and almost bankrupt family. With mechanics that sometimes feel like a movement-based puzzle, sometimes feel like a classic adventure and sometimes feel like a survival game, everything about it makes me happy to simply exist. It&#39;s such a unique game, with so much personality, that it really deserves a remake to correct some issues that have aged poorly in this great little game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;03) Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo DS/iOS, Capcom, 2011&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An absolute truth: very few stories ever told in ANY MEDIA are more engaging, surprising and crazy than the plot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.capcom-games.com/ghosttrick/en-us/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A DS classic that was lost in an iOS port, it is an extremely unique and wonderful game. From character design to the sequence of plot events, I took advantage of my last two days off from work to just play this thing. I just played this game, for real, nothing else. As much as it has its problems, the innovative “owning objects” mechanic is an even more dynamic version of the point-and-click idea that also works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;02) Spin Rhythm XD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac, Super Spin Digital, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spin Rhythm XD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m an avowed fan of rhythm games, but I&#39;m not the person who&#39;s going to spend hours learning how to do Full Combos. But in many games, on the simplest difficulties, that feeling of playing an instrument (or at least being one with the music) doesn&#39;t happen as much. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spinrhythmgame.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spin Rhythm XD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; managed to make me be in that state of flow even on lower difficulties, with very fluid and natural gameplay and a good selection of electronic music. The game is still in early access, but should be officially released soon. If you like music games like me, it&#39;s definitely worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;01) Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameCube, Intelligent Systems/Nintendo, 2004&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2021/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Nintendo 64 game was already something very memorable for me, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-GameCube/Paper-Mario-The-Thousand-Year-Door-268500.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a masterpiece, remnants of a Nintendo that unfortunately no longer exists. Everything is different, it&#39;s strange, it&#39;s different, from the story to the characters and how that little world is built. Each chapter has a somewhat distinct structure, the mechanics have been improved and brought to near perfection. It&#39;s very sad to think that this game is stuck in the purple cube to this day, because it is by far one of the best things I&#39;ve ever played and a perfect recommendation for those who like different RPGs. &lt;strong&gt;The Thousand-Year Door deserves my Played of the Year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played a lot, a lot of &lt;strong&gt;Picross/Nonogram&lt;/strong&gt; this year on the Nintendo 3DS, it was my thing when I was very tired. The best were the Japan-exclusive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mariowiki.com/Club_Nintendo_Picross&quot;&gt;Club Nintendo Picross&lt;/a&gt; and the themed &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/e0bd3a7355ae978b&quot;&gt;My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-download-software/Sanrio-characters-Picross-1395729.html&quot;&gt;Sanrio characters Picross&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My “mobile point-and-click franchise that I marathoned in a week” of the year was the bizarre &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.jp.ne.hap.mom&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden my game by mom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (available on consoles as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kemco-games.com/global/games/mom/index.html&quot;&gt;Mom Hid My Game!&lt;/a&gt;). The games don&#39;t make any sense, the puzzles have absurd solutions, but it&#39;s very funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii/Beat-the-Beat-Rhythm-Paradise-280605.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhythm Heaven Fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhhoPxCWZeg&quot;&gt;one of the best songs in video games&lt;/a&gt; in the credits and I was finally able to play it until the end to see this masterpiece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&#39;t know there were idle games with a story, but this year I was shown &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaceplan.click/&quot;&gt;Spaceplan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://petertalisman.quest/&quot;&gt;Peter Talisman: Lord of the Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. Each one in their own way, they have very different proposals in the genre that I find very interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three worst games I played this year were quite peculiar: the game with much more budget than it should have &lt;strong&gt;The Solitaire Conspiracy&lt;/strong&gt;, the musical gacha &lt;strong&gt;Beatstar&lt;/strong&gt; and the overrated adventure game &lt;strong&gt;The Dream Machine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was my &lt;strong&gt;2nd Played of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backloggd.com/u/gabtoschi/list/2021-played-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;You can see a more complete list on my Backloggd&lt;/a&gt;, if you want. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and see you on POTY again next year!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Not every game story needs to be about “saving the world”</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/different-stories-in-games.html"/>
    <updated>2021-11-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/different-stories-in-games.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Without falling into too many generalisms, it can be said that many stories told in video games always have as their main figure a hero character. They are about to live an adventure to &lt;strong&gt;solve a problem that puts a lot at risk&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the death of someone important or saving the world of a great catastrophe. Trials, challenges, losses and discoveries are part not only of game plots, but of many, many incredible stories in media, which have spanned generations and are still told to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which isn&#39;t necessarily a problem, right? The fact that Mario is going to save the princess for the 1000th time doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that this is going to be the beginning of a phenomenal game. Just because half of the medieval RPGs out there consist of a standard Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons group looking for seven magical orbs to save the world doesn&#39;t mean that good stories and good games can&#39;t emerge in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surviving these last few months in the real world has already been quite a challenge, considering all the crises that Brazil is going through simultaneously. It&#39;s no surprise that video games were one of the escape valves that I used to get through the difficult days. As much as I like being a hero by pushing half a dozen buttons, I started to realize that I was becoming interested in things that just... didn&#39;t do that? I don&#39;t know if it was the anxiety and fear of these months or something else, but there were days when &lt;strong&gt;I just didn&#39;t want to save the world&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that several games can bring this feeling: abstract puzzle games like Tetris can be a great and calm pastime, and sandboxes like Minecraft or Terraria allow you to build your own path in that world. But that&#39;s not exactly what I want to talk about: I&#39;m here to talk about &lt;strong&gt;simple stories, without many promises, but which in difficult times warmed my heart&lt;/strong&gt; and I definitely want to see more of that in the future. Because I think I&#39;ll need it (and maybe more people will need it too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A story about changes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game that inspired me to write this text was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unpackinggame.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpacking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, released this year by Australian studio &lt;a href=&quot;https://witchbeam.com.au/&quot;&gt;Witch Beam&lt;/a&gt; and published by Humble Games. I remember learning about this game through some GIF in a random tweet and its premise couldn&#39;t be more peculiar: a puzzle game about literally moving: taking things out of boxes and putting them in their rightful place when moving houses. I like strange and different games, I knew I would want to try it when it came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzle itself was really fun, trying to fit everything into its place was very interesting. At least until the part where he made me decide whether a random fabric was a washcloth, a dishtowel, or a pillowcase. But anyway, playing Unpacking was a pleasant experience in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/different-stories-in-games/unpacking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unpacking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just didn&#39;t expect &lt;strong&gt;how completely invested&lt;/strong&gt; I would be in the game&#39;s story. In fact, I didn&#39;t even expect the game to actually have a story! I could have sworn it would just be a series of rooms, with you trying to fit everything into place without anything left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not! Unlike this, Unpacking tells about &lt;strong&gt;the same person moving houses at different moments in their life&lt;/strong&gt;. Every new house, every new object you take out of a box tells a part of that person&#39;s story. I don&#39;t want to give spoilers about what happens, but if you&#39;re going to (re)play, I invite you to pay attention to them. From objects that are worn out or reused in other places, or even the houses you find and what they represent. &lt;strong&gt;Everything in Unpacking helps tell this story&lt;/strong&gt;, painting this character&#39;s life in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it&#39;s a short story about &lt;strong&gt;the changes in life that everyone goes through&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of them bring good things, others not so much, but we correct them and move on to start the next one. For someone who is going through a process of many changes like me, I can&#39;t think of a better medium than the interactivity of a video game to tell a story in this way and I think Unpacking does a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A story about discoveries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I thought about other games that I could use as examples in this text, the first thing that came to my mind was the wonder that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ashorthike.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Short Hike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did in my life when I played it last year. Created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adamgryu&quot;&gt;Adam Robinson-Yu&lt;/a&gt;, I ended up coming across the title during one of the free play weeks on the Epic Games Store and, after much praise from some friends, I decided to try it out on a night where I was tired, exhausted and very scared after the second month of quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;ve had few happier experiences with video games than playing this game. The concept, as you might expect at this point, is very simple: you help the bird Claire explore a provincial park and manage to climb a mountain to get signal for her cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/different-stories-in-games/ashorthike.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Short Hike&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before talking about the story, I need to praise how enjoyable it is to play this game. The movement, the flying, the exploration, the progression, the sidequests, the art style, the dialogue, everything in this game seems to have been made with so much care &lt;strong&gt;with the only goal of bringing a smile to my face&lt;/strong&gt;. Playing A Short Hike is very good and would still be a wonderful game to play even without being as cozy as it is. But he does it and still manages to warm my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this game is about a teenager who was pushed by her aunt to visit a mountain in a park for a week — and all she wants is to get a cell phone signal. After all, what kind of young person cares about a calm and peaceful stay on a mountain? I was once that kind of young person, I&#39;ve met a lot of people who are still that kind of young person. But this game is also about her (and you) walking around the mountain, meeting people, making friends, &lt;strong&gt;exploring a different place and discovering new things&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel to a beautiful park, talk to people there, look for shells on the beach, learn to climb, fish in a calm lake: &lt;strong&gt;A Short Hike&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&#39;t try to change the world, it just tells a story about discovering a new place and invites you to participate in it. I&#39;m happy that this place is incredible, fun and did me a lot of good in a very difficult week. No wonder it made my &lt;a href=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2020&quot;&gt;POTY 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A story about new beginnings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another game that stood out to me these last few months was &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202900/Assemble_with_Care/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assemble with Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the British team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ustwogames.co.uk/games/assemble/&quot;&gt;Ustwo Games&lt;/a&gt;. Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive and from the same creators of the mobile classic Monument Valley, this game had been on my wishlist for a long time. Not only because it&#39;s a puzzle game, but also because of the theme: you follow Maria, an antique-restorer, who arrives in a Spanish city looking for things to fix and earn a few bucks to enjoy the gastronomic festival at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game enchanted me in a few different ways. The first one was how fixing things in the game was fun and simple: the puzzles weren&#39;t very difficult, but they always brought new elements and were very interesting. Somehow, it was as &lt;strong&gt;if I could do the same things my father did when I was a child&lt;/strong&gt;; I felt like I had the same skills as him, even if it was just for a few minutes in a video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/different-stories-in-games/assemble.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assemble with Care&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, the way this game presents its little world is also something that caught my attention: every object worth repairing is important to someone. As you get to know the people of the city and repair their objects, you will understand their problems and what those objects represent. I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the stories that objects can have and how they can represent someone&#39;s (or a group&#39;s) life. Being able to somehow &lt;strong&gt;give these objects a new life and start a new chapter for these people&lt;/strong&gt; was something very special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the stories were really dramatic: they were just ordinary problems, faced by ordinary people. But &lt;strong&gt;they could be part of anyone&#39;s life&lt;/strong&gt;, from the child who really likes their video games to the watch that has come passed through generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of me wanted this game to never end, that I could go to a new city, learn more about the lives of people and their objects. Maybe this game doesn&#39;t click with you as much compared to how much it pleased me, but a part of me wanted to be able to go around fixing things and discovering stories as simple, but as cozy as the plots of &lt;strong&gt;Assemble with Care&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A story about pranks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I know it&#39;s going to seem a little out of tone talking about this game, but I think it&#39;s a good counter example to show that these games that I&#39;m now a fan of don&#39;t just have to be about beautiful and intimate stories. Because I definitely also didn&#39;t save the world in &lt;a href=&quot;https://goose.game/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untitled Goose Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://househou.se/&quot;&gt;House House&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/&quot;&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt;. If you&#39;ve ever seen a GIF of &lt;strong&gt;a goose seeking to be the very incarnation of chaos&lt;/strong&gt;, you know what game I&#39;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/different-stories-in-games/goose.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Untitled Goose Game&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like thinking about the meeting where the idea for this game was discussed: “&lt;strong&gt;what if you could be the irritating goose on the face of the planet?&lt;/strong&gt;”. And really, isn&#39;t that stupidly fun!? Even though the controls are a little strange and the missions can be frustrating at some point, I played this thing in co-op with my girlfriend and it was &lt;strong&gt;really, really fun&lt;/strong&gt;. It was quite interesting how we would casually take turns which goose would do the game task and which one would just honk at all the humans to scare them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my favorite thing about this game is &lt;strong&gt;the commitment to the simple, pure story they wanted to tell&lt;/strong&gt;. You are a despicable goose who will do whatever you want to do. And that&#39;s it! At the same time, as you change people&#39;s lives, you begin to understand who they are, what the relationship is between those people and what their relationship is with the geese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s really good how the whole concept of the game is just an episode of an old cartoon like Woody Woodpecker or Tom &amp;amp; Jerry: animals destroying everything with minimal reason while we laugh a lot. It&#39;s cool how the tasks that the game gives you are not just objectives, but also serve to modify the world around you and help tell the story of those people that afternoon. And the ending, which is already mechanically very cool, also ties up the entire saga in search of absolute chaos. &lt;strong&gt;HONK!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The next stories?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, these may not be the most common in video games, but they are &lt;strong&gt;stories from our real world&lt;/strong&gt;, emotions and moments that we all go through. In reality, I connected a lot with them because I am also going through moments of changes, discoveries, new beginnings &lt;s&gt;and the search for the complete chaos of the universe&lt;/s&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was written as a way to talk more about them, to inspire more people to look for new types of plots in the games they consume. If you already like this type of game, perhaps now you have some recommendations. If you&#39;ve never thought about it that way, I hope one of the games here inspires you to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I&#39;m rooting for a better future for all of us, but these &lt;strong&gt;games that warm my heart&lt;/strong&gt; won&#39;t stay away from me. While there should be plenty more out there to try, there are plenty more coming out in the future that I want to be able to keep an eye on for them — like the dreamy rhythm game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.halfasleep.games/melatonin/&quot;&gt;Melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, the Indian cooking simulator &lt;a href=&quot;https://venbagame.com/&quot;&gt;Venba&lt;/a&gt;, and the organization puzzle &lt;a href=&quot;https://maxinferno.itch.io/a-little-to-the-left&quot;&gt;A Little to the Left&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, these games aren&#39;t about saving the world, &lt;strong&gt;but being able to experience these stories saved a little part of my world when I needed it most&lt;/strong&gt;. I think it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best digital games I played in 2020</title>
    <link href="https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2020.html"/>
    <updated>2020-12-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gabtoschi.com/blog/best-digital-games-2020.html</id>
    <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020 was a tough year&lt;/strong&gt;, without a doubt. And videogames seemed to be a great escape valve for all the pressure of the pandemic. It&#39;s been a while since I spent so much time playing games. Of course, I also started to learn about board game design, to rewatch Doctor Who with my girlfriend and even discovered new ones (&lt;em&gt;Good Omens, I&#39;m looking to you&lt;/em&gt;). But videogames were an essential technique to avoid going crazy staying in home this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never was a person able to play all the new games that were launched every day... financially speaking. Although I played a lot this year, most of it was old games that were on my backlog for years now. But they also deserve a spot on my year&#39;s roundup, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is, officially, my first &lt;strong&gt;POTY&lt;/strong&gt; — the &lt;strong&gt;Played of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;! I did some lists in the past, but now I have a ranking of &lt;strong&gt;the best 20 digital games that I played in 2020&lt;/strong&gt;. There were not launched in 2020, but I played them for the first time this year, and that&#39;s how it counts in my heart. My pal Geoff can have his trophies, because now I have my own to give. Let&#39;s start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;20) Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#39;s Revenge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Boy Advance, 2003, Rare, THQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#39;s Revenge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banjo-Kazooie has always been a game that I played many times, but never finished. Getting to do this for the franchise&#39;s forgotten chapter is a funny fact. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZOBhJu2mss&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grunty&#39;s Revenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tries to bring the idea of a collectathon to a 2D portable (much weaker than the N64) and... it works impressively well!? The game is obviously simpler and smaller, but it has its charm and it was really cool to get practically 100% on it. If you like 3D platformers in strange places, that&#39;s one to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;19) Pikuniku&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux/Switch, 2019, Sectordub, Devolver Digital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pikuniku&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tired, exhausted and going through a shit week when I played &lt;a href=&quot;https://pikuniku.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pikuniku&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it was exactly what I needed. A very silly and simple story, with cute visual and funny, easy mechanics: everything my mind needed to disconnect from the world a little and have a laugh. Maybe on a normal day I wouldn&#39;t have found the game so good, so here&#39;s my recommendation: try playing Pikuniku on a shitty day, when you just need to switch off and laugh at any nonsense. It&#39;s going to be a great night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;18) GNOG&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/iOS/PS4, 2017, KO_OP, Double Fine Presents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GNOG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnoggame.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GNOG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was one of the games that I had never heard of, but that caught my attention while browsing &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality&quot;&gt;itch.io&#39;s Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality&lt;/a&gt;. The first of some point-and-click games on the list, &lt;strong&gt;GNOG&lt;/strong&gt; is very simple and fun, but SO BEAUTIFUL and SO COLORFUL. It throws colors in your face to tell slightly abstract stories, focused on a large, complex object. It&#39;s like The Room (we&#39;ll talk about it later), but with a psychedelic art direction. It only took only two nights to complete, but it was a really cool and interesting experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;17) Picross e2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo 3DS, 2011, Jupiter Corporation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picross e2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t know, &lt;strong&gt;Picross&lt;/strong&gt; (or nonogram) is a type of Japanese magazine puzzle that is very famous around the world. It may look like Sudoku from afar, but is very different: you use numbers around the grid to form a drawing by painting the correct squares. 2020 was clearly the year that I embraced my love for Picross and this was one of the reasons: I spent two hours EVERYDAY lying in bed listening to podcasts and solving those puzzles. It was a really cool way to relax and disconnect from the always-ending world outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-download-software/PICROSS-e2-703722.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picross e2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also included a new mode that I loved called Micross, which is a large puzzle divided into small parts, forming more complex images. I highly recommend it, mainly due to the quality that Jupiter Corporation puts into its games (a tip: look for the Picross S series on your Nintendo Switch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;16) Dedede&#39;s Drum Dash Deluxe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo 3DS, 2014, HAL Laboratory, Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dedede&#39;s Drum Dash Deluxe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of game I wanted was bigger, because it ends very, very quickly. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-download-software/Dedede-s-Drum-Dash-Deluxe-950473.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dedede&#39;s Drum Dash Deluxe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a bigger version of one of the 3DS&#39; Triple Deluxe minigames, but bigger (in this case) is still very small. Anyway, it was one of the physics-based rhythm games that I enjoyed playing the most! I never liked the idea of having to follow a character&#39;s actions to the rhythm of the music (I&#39;ve always preferred more abstract games with less delay), but DDDD is very well made and fun to play, even when it puts you in some absurd traps during the levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;15) Carcassonne&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Android/Switch, 2017, Frima Studio, Asmodee Digital&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Carcassonne&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this game just falls under the board game quota that a list of mine should have, but it was really cool to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asmodee-digital.com/en/carcassonne/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at a time when playing boardgames physically wasn&#39;t safe. Not only because of the game itself, which is really cool, with classic but fun mechanics, but because of the digital version itself, which makes counting points and reading the board a lot easier. It&#39;s pretty rare to say this, but it&#39;s probably better to play &lt;strong&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/strong&gt; digitally than physically and that&#39;s definitely a reason for it to be on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;14) The Room Two&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Android/iOS, 2013, Fireproof Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Room Two&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Room&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the best point-and-click / &amp;quot;escape room&amp;quot; series available today, from the construction of puzzles in super complex mechanical boxes, to the mystical setting of the entire plot. I&#39;ll talk about it again later, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fireproofgames.com/games/the-room-two&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Room Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is very competent in bringing a good and fun experience. I recommend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;13) El Tango de la Muerte&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC, 2018, Hernán Smicht, YIRA::&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;El Tango de la Muerte&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hidden gem from the itch.io&#39;s bundle, I knew how much I would like &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/701380/El_Tango_de_la_Muerte/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;El Tango de la Muerte&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just for its unusual premise: a 1920&#39;s Argentine soap opera about a forbidden love, filled with music and tango dancing, wrapping a sliding rhythm game with visuals based on old Monty Python animations. Few things make me happier as a player (and developer) than seeing different stories being told in the best way possible. It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s definitely an experience I&#39;ve never had and it&#39;s worth having too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;12) Super Mario Bros.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NES (Nintendo 3DS), 1985, Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fight me if you want, but 2020 was the first time I finished a 2D Mario game — and it was the most classic of all. Really, even with the 80s controls, even with the simplest plot possible, it&#39;s incredible how fun and inventive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Super-Mario-Bros-803853.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is. It shows how new levels manage to bring new features using just a few sprites and how it&#39;s possible to get really invested in a game from 35 years ago. SMB is not only a game that went down in history for the impact it had, but it is still a (not perfect but) really cool experience to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;11) Frog Fractions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash/PC, 2012/2020, Twinbeard Studios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Frog Fractions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twinbeard.com/frog-fractions/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frog Fractions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a short, strange, funny and memorable experience. Anything I say will ruin your gameplay, so just play now. Maybe using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1194840/Frog_Fractions_Game_of_the_Decade_Edition/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Game of the Decade&amp;quot; port available on Steam for free&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;10) BOXBOY!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo 3DS, 2015, HAL Laboratory, Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BOXBOY!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-download-software/BOXBOY--982038.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOXBOY!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also the reason why I liked the game so much: it has SO MUCH content that it&#39;s tiring! Because it has such simple, yet cool and useful mechanics — being able to create blocks using the character you control —, you basically have hundreds of levels, on different difficulties. Without a doubt, it is a game that focuses on being a good puzzle platformer and it succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;09) Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo 3DS, 2013, Level-5, Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Layton&lt;/strong&gt; is one of my favorite game series and the end of the original trilogy (Unwound Future) is one of my favorite games of all time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-games/Professor-Layton-and-the-Azran-Legacy-809288.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azran Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also in its role as the end of a trilogy, is not such an exceptional game, but it manages to bring new elements (and an ending) to the great story of the Azran, as well as concluding in an incredibly beautiful way a series that brought me a lot of happiness. We&#39;ll talk more about Layton on this list, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;08) The Room: Old Sins&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/iOS/Android, 2018, Fireproof Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Room: Old Sins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised, we&#39;re talking about &lt;strong&gt;The Room&lt;/strong&gt; series again, specifically the best game in the franchise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fireproofgames.com/games/theroomoldsins&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old Sins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; not only takes the series&#39; formula to a very high level of quality, but also brings different mechanics and ways of seeing the world, now interconnected. If the series was about unraveling complicated mechanical boxes, it is possible to see the entire game as one big box, a natural and very welcome evolution. If you like escape room games, you now know what to play next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;07) Picross 3D: Round 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo 3DS, 2016, HAL Laboratory, Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picross 3D: Round 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we will also talk about Picross again... kinda? When I tried Picross 3D for the first time on the DS, it had such different gameplay and the game was so busy with the different mechanics that I simply put it aside within a few minutes. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-games/Picross-3D-Round-2-1136168.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picross 3D: Round 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does an incredible job of introducing those new mechanics, making the game way more cozy and relaxing. Before long, I felt more comfortable playing in 3D, especially in more difficult puzzles, as the idea of destroying blocks made more sense in my head sometimes. I need a new one on the Switch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;06) Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS2/PS3/Wii/Xbox 360/PC/Mac, 2007, Neversoft, Activision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a big fan of rhythm games, but I&#39;d never actually played the famous plastic guitar franchise until this year — I was a PC boy and didn&#39;t had a PS2. However, after all, I have to say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lmhXNnZ_ps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the best way to start. Even though I&#39;m not a rock fan, it was really cool to be able to follow the songs and get better and better on the scores, follow the band&#39;s story in career mode and even play with my brother. It took a while, but I finally understood why Guitar Hero was always so acclaimed (and why people miss it so much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;05) Mario &amp;amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser&#39;s Minions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo 3DS, 2017, ALPHADREAM, Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mario &amp;amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser&#39;s Minions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always been a big fan of Mario RPGs and Paper Mario will always be one of my lifelong favorite games, but I&#39;ve never really had the opportunity to play something from its sister series on handhelds, &lt;strong&gt;Mario &amp;amp; Luigi&lt;/strong&gt;. Starting from the beginning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS-games/Mario-Luigi-Superstar-Saga-Bowser-s-Minions-1234324.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superstar Saga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was an incredible start, in a remake with several changes to improve the game&#39;s quality of life without leaving aside the great story and battle system. My experiences with its sequels weren&#39;t so good, but this one is worthy of a Top 5 recommendation. &lt;em&gt;(P.S.: Bowser&#39;s Minions is boring, I played 5 minutes and never touched it again)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;04) Professor Layton and the Last Specter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo DS, 2011, Level-5, Nintendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Professor Layton and the Last Specter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last double feature on this list, we&#39;re going to talk about &lt;strong&gt;Professor Layton&lt;/strong&gt; again. Specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-DS/Professor-Layton-and-the-Spectre-s-Call-272596.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Specter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or Spectre&#39;s Call in Europe), the first game in the prequel trilogy and the last one before the transition to 3D. I like it more on 2D, in fact: the games on the 3DS were slower, the puzzles were slightly less creative and the absurd focus on trying to take advantage of the 3D screen was a burden. That said, &lt;strong&gt;Last Specter&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&#39;t hold a candle to the end of the original trilogy, but it has beauty in its visuals, in the story and in the creativity of its puzzles, being one of the best in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;03) A Short Hike&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac/Linux/Switch, 2019, Adam Robinson-Yu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Short Hike&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an incredible game that entered this year&#39;s POTY as one of those moments in which I managed to forget the cruel reality that 2020 had in store for us and FINALLY was able to relax. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ashorthike.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Short Hike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with its extremely beautiful visuals, its simple and fun dialogues, and a series of things to do on the island was my perfect escape valve. There&#39;s no way to play it and not enjoy the game, have lots of fun and be excited about what those 3 hours of play would bring. If you need a cuddle in some difficult times, I think you need to do this short hike too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;02) There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Mac, 2020, Draw Me A Pixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I first saw this game, I knew it would make this list (which is being written hours after finishing it). The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1241700/There_Is_No_Game_Jam_Edition_2015/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There Is No Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was an incredible idea, well executed within its small scope. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drawmeapixel.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong Dimension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in other hand, expands the concept incredibly, both in story and gameplay, showing what is perhaps one of the most innovative and interesting point-and-click games ever made. A masterpiece made to be played without any kind of spoilers, it is a game that I highly recommend and made me finish the year very well. Some jokes are not THAT funny, but they can be perfect, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;01) PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC/Xbox 360/PS3/Windows Phone/iOS/Android, 2013, Mine Loader Software, Namco Bandai Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gabtoschi.com/img/posts/best-digital-games-2020/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the 2020&#39;s Played of the Year goes to… Pac-Man.&lt;/strong&gt; Amazing, right? Elegant games always fascinated me, it&#39;s so beautiful to use simple gameplay rules to awaken so many emotions. That&#39;s where my love for board games comes from: I&#39;m fascinated by how paper and half a dozen rules can make people have fun for hours. &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/236450/PACMAN_Championship_Edition_DX/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; left me hyped and excited, with a crazy feeling of victory and fun using the rules of one of the most famous and popular games in the world. It&#39;s still Pac-Man, but it&#39;s the best Pac-Man can be and I loved it. May in 2021 I discover another game as elegantly incredible as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cookie Clicker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remains the best clicker ever made in history and gets even better when played on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dashnet.cookieclicker&quot;&gt;mobile version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year I discovered and played several games from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rustylake.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rusty Lake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team focused on making point-and-click escape games. After playing a dozen of them, my favorites were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-seasons.html&quot;&gt;Cube Escape: Seasons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/samsara-room.html&quot;&gt;Samsara Room&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-paradox.html&quot;&gt;Cube Escape: Paradox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incredibly, the &amp;quot;worst&amp;quot; game I played this year was also theirs — &lt;strong&gt;Cube Escape: The Lake&lt;/strong&gt; —, by far the weakest episode in the Cube Escape series and one of the most boring escape room games I&#39;ve ever played.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020 was when I learned to play solitaire for the first time, actually! The one I played most was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solitaire-deckedout.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solitaire: Decked Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was my &lt;strong&gt;1st Played of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;! 2020 was a very difficult, complicated and painful year and 2021 won&#39;t start much different. At least, I was able to reconnect with a hobby that I really enjoy - safe at home, of course. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backloggd.com/u/gabtoschi/list/2020-played-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;You can see a more complete list on my Backloggd&lt;/a&gt;, if you want. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and see you on POTY again next year!&lt;/p&gt;
