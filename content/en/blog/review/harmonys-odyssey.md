I love puzzle games, but not every puzzle game I like needs to be big and complex. Sometimes, I only need a simple jigsaw puzzle to solve when I listen to a podcast and zone out after a stressful day. Beautiful pictures, a good interface, no timers and I can chill connecting pieces as this was the only thing I have to do (it isn't). **Harmony's Odyssey** has almost all of that, but not in a pleasing package.

There's a small story being told here: a little witch girl had a cat problem with her magic wand and **all the world was broken into scrambled pieces**. Your goal in **Harmony's Odyssey** is to click in pairs of blocks to swap their positions and remount the dioramas using only the broken objects as clues. To be fair, **it works** but nothing really gets your attention. The scenarios are really colorful (sometimes too much colorful) and it's easy to solve each puzzle.

The real problem of **Harmony's Odyssey** to me isn't that core gameplay, but the bad decisions that were used to wrap it. I'm a huge fan of interfaces that only uses symbols to convey all the buttons and actions, but **I still can't understand what some things mean here.** Is this a bonus level or a required challenge? Am I buying an upgrade or unlocking an achievement? Where is the next puzzle to solve??? I wanted answers, but only got frustration.

And when I think I found my way through the bizarre UI, I found **minigames in Harmony's Odyssey**. Trusting your classic game knowledge (because all of them are inspired by old magazine puzzles), **the game doesn't have real explanation of how they work**. I know there was a "spot the differences" minigame, but apparently I can't miss a click? And you can get upgrades to help you, but they only works in some specific styles? Once again, I wish I had understood what was happening there.

Even if you're not bothered by the confusing interface or frustrating minigames, all you'll get in **Harmony's Odyssey** is still mediocre jigsaw puzzles. The dioramas themselves are cute and colorful, and solving them isn't necessarily bad, but I believe there are best options in the stores if you just want to put some beautiful pieces together. I was expecting some magic in my relaxing time, but I don't think this magical wand is my type.
