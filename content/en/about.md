Hi! Pull a chair, sit down and welcome to my cozy home in the internet hell! **My name is Gabriel Toschi (he/him)**, I'm a Brazilian software engineer, amateur game designer and non-fiction writer. But in this website, I'm just a silly person trying to have fun with my projects and articles. I live nowadays on Taubaté, a country town in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, with my wife and my three cats.

Well, what I can say about myself? If this was a job resume, I would say that I graduated as a Computer Science bachelor from the [Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação at the University of São Paulo (ICMC-USP)](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/about) — and did way more calculus tests that I wanted. Nowadays, I work as a front-end web developer in a major retail company in Brazil and I'm not looking for new opportunities.

**But you are not here for this, are you?** You probably have seen an article about Club Penguin minigames and wanted to see who wrote it! So, yeah, [I'm a person that always have been on the internet](/blog/why-i-created-this-blog), since I was born, and now I finally got a web space to be proud of. I'm always using my **curiosity** to learn about things that catch my eye, my **creativity** to make new things and remix the ones that already exists, and the **chaos** inside me to go one step further and have a little bit of fun.

In this website, you will found a (non-exhaustive) of [all my past projects](/#projects), including digital and tabletop games that I made and articles that I wrote in other places. And [in my blog](/blog), I'm always writing original texts and reviews. If you want to get in touch, you can send me an email in **eu (at) gabtoschi (dot) com**, or follow me on [Telegram](https://t.me/gabtoschi), [Mastodon](https://peoplemaking.games/@gabtoschi), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gabtoschi.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gabtoschi) or [my Steam curator page](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44763507/).
